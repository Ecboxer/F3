Conviction and Exoneration





In the early hours of April 20, 1989, the body of a woman barely clinging to life was discovered in Central Park. Assaulted and left for dead, the 28-year-old jogger, Trisha Meili, would survive grave injuries and a coma with no memory of the events. Within days of the attack, McCray, 15; Richardson, 14; Salaam, 15; Santana, 14; and Wise, 16, implicated themselves in Meili's rape and beating after hours of psychological pressure and aggressive interrogation at the hands of seasoned homicide detectives.
The police announced to a press hungry for sensational crime stories that the young men had been part of a gang of teenagers who were out ""wilding,"" assaulting joggers and bicyclists in Central Park that evening. The ensuing media frenzy was met with a public outcry for justice. The young men were tried as adults under New York laws of the day — and convicted, despite inconsistent and inaccurate confessions, DNA evidence that excluded them, and no eyewitness accounts that connected them to the victim.
On December 19, 2002, Justice Charles J. Tejada of the Supreme Court of the State of New York granted a motion to vacate the thirteen-year-old convections in the infamous case. He did so based on new evidence: a shocking confession from a serial rapist, Matias Reyes, and a positive DNA match to back it up. A year later, the men filed civil lawsuits against the City of New York, and the police officers and prosecutors who had worked toward their conviction. In 2014, they settled that civil case for $41 million dollars. Despite their exoneration, the police and prosecutors involved in the case maintain that they were guilty of the crime.

8c4f09b0-4746-41a2-84ec-783c719722af,"On March 12, 2023, social media users spread the claim that 15 banks in the U.S. had shut down under former U.S. President Donald Trump. We found the claim to be true. The subject emerged in partisan discussions of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse on March 10. With $209 billion in assets when it closed, it was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, behind Washington Mutual's failure in 2008. Silicon Valley Bank's failure also prompted regulators to close Signature Bank, which was the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history. The bank had $110 billion in assets when it closed. Another bank, Silvergate Capitol, announced its intent to wind down operations and liquidate its assets on March 8. MarketWatch reported the bank was facing multiple lawsuits that accused the bank of not having adequate protections to detect money laundering on its platform. The bank had $11 billion in assets at the end of 2022. ""More people should be talking about the fact that 15 banks failed while Donald Trump was president,"" said a Twitter post from progressive political action committee MeidasTouch . Playing the same game of partisan ""whataboutism,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted that he didn't remember any banks collapsing during his father's administration, prompting journalist Jake Sherman to provide a list: Banks did fail under trump. many. here is the list of bank failures. https://t.co/EdDZDwrsSL https://t.co/6SIbHMbr6v — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) March 12, 2023 According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) , there were indeed 15 bank failures during Trump's presidency: four in 2020, four in 2019 and seven in 2017. Additionally, Harvest Community Bank , which was located in New Jersey, closed on Jan. 13, 2017, a week before Trump took office. Here is a list of the banks that closed, with dates of closure: Seaway Bank and Trust Company: Jan. 27, 2017 Proficio Bank: March 3, 2017 First NBC Bank: April 28, 2017 Guaranty Bank, (doing business as BestBank in Georgia & Michigan): May 5, 2017 Fayette County Bank: May 26, 2017 The Farmers and Merchants State Bank of Argonia: October 13, 2017 Washington Federal Bank for Savings: December 15, 2017 The Enloe State Bank: May 31, 2019 Louisa Community Bank: October 25, 2019 Resolute Bank: October 25, 2019 City National Bank of New Jersey: November 1, 2019 Ericson State Bank: February 14, 2020 The First State Bank: April 3, 2020 First City Bank of Florida: October 16, 2020 Almena State Bank: October 23, 2020 The partisan blame game fails to address economic factors underlying bank failures. Many factors could cause a bank to fail, including undercapitalization, liquidity, safety and soundness, and fraud. Attributing those failures solely to the political party in power ignores those nuances, as well as what lessons can be learned to prevent other banks from failing in the future. The banks that closed during Trump's presidency were significantly smaller in size. The largest was Seaway Bank and Trust Company, which had $361.2 million in assets when it failed in 2017.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,598
2610c9a4-4a67-47b9-a966-b223c179ed84,"As U.S. President Joe Biden left Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 22, 2023, after a surprise visit to Ukraine , videos of him stumbling while climbing stairs to Air Force One went viral. The footage appeared to show him walking up the stairs, and, near the top, stumbling slightly and falling forward. He caught himself, stood up and continued to climb. Sharing the clip, Liz Wheeler, the host of a conservative political commentary podcast, wrote on Twitter, ""Joe Biden trips and falls up the stairs on Air Force One."" To determine whether the clip was real or miscaptioned, we looked for longer videos of Biden's walk up the stairs from reputable news sources. By examining footage from Sky News, for instance, at the 18-minute mark, we saw Biden did indeed stumble: We reached out to the White House for confirmation and received its pool report for the day. That document read: ""The president boarded at 5:34. About half way up the main stairs he stumbled and fell forward. He quickly recovered, stood and continued to the door, giving a quick wave before going in."" Given that acknowledgment from the White House, as well as the clear, undoctored video evidence that shows Biden stumbling, we rate this claim as ""True."" The videos of the fall are not to be confused with miscaptioned footage from earlier in the trip — a clip that supposedly showed Biden falling down the stairs when disembarking from Air Force One. In that video, the individual who fell was not actually the president. Critics of Biden used the Feb. 22 slip to comment on Biden's health, question his fitness for office, and recall his past stumbles . (We have covered Biden's falls before, including a time he fell off a bicycle in 2022. Also, the February 2023 incident was not the first time cameras caught Biden tripping while boarding Air Force One.) We should note that questioning a president's physical and mental health is a reoccurring trend no matter who is in in the Oval Office or their political affiliation.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,397

		Who Sits Where at the President's State of the Union Address?	

			Here's a breakdown of the seating in the gallery and where all the major players in Washington, D.C. will sit

FILE - President Joe Biden, center, speaks during a State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on, March 1, 2022.



President Joe Biden will deliver the State of the Union address on Tuesday. The annual speech brings together the three branches of government under one roof and allows the president to make the case that the nation is strong and that better days lie ahead.
The State of the Union is full of pomp and circumstance, with some traditions dating back to the nation's founding while others are more modern adaptions. One convention that receives plenty of attention is the seating chart. Who sits where is part custom and part political play. 
Here's a breakdown of the seating in the gallery and where all the major players in Washington, D.C. will sit:

The President
President Biden will deliver his speech on the dais surrounded by every single member of Congress — except those who chose to skip the event in protest — the Supreme Court justices, his cabinet members, the joint chiefs of staff and the Capitol Hill press corps. 
Behind the president on the left will be Vice President Kamala Harris and on the right, new GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy wielding the gavel for the first time since stepping into the role.
Congress
Lawmakers are split in the gallery by party affiliation, with Republicans to the president's left and Democrats to Biden's right. Senators from each party get the front row seats and House lawmakers fill in the rows behind them. 
Aside from reserved places for leadership, seats in the chamber are not assigned to members. However, they are allowed to claim a seat at any time during the day — as long they remain physically in the seat to hold their place for the speech. That means some lawmakers camp out in the aisle for hours a head of the address in order to retain the coveted aisle seat.
Supreme Court Justices
While the Constitution makes no mention of Supreme Court justices attending the State of the Union,  most of the the justices have shown up in their official robes over the years and taken designated seats in front of the Democrats in the gallery. Chief Justice John Roberts said in a 2010 interview, whether to attend is “up to each individual member of the Court.” Justice Samuel Alito hasn’t attended a State of the Union since 2010 and the late Justice Antonin Scalia stopped going in 1997 after deciding it was a ""childish spectacle.""
Cabinet Members
Across the aisle from the high court's justices is President Biden's cabinet members. These include the heads of the 15 executive departments: the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, and the Attorney General.
Additionally, the Cabinet includes the White House Chief of Staff, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, the Director of National Intelligence, and the U.S. Trade Representative, as well as the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Small Business Administration.
First Lady and Guests 
The first lady and the president's guests typically sit together in the box behind and above congressional Republicans. This year's list of guests include Rock star Bono, the 26-year-old who disarmed a gunman in last month's Monterey Park, California, shooting, and the family of Tyre Nichols. 
Press Corps
The Capitol Hill press corps sit directly behind and above the president. They cannot see the president from the press gallery, but the vantage point offers them a view of the audience to gauge the reactions of members of Congress to the president's speech.

41689b05-9ea9-45c7-a937-80c265845b11,"On Feb. 1, 2023, at least two GOP members of Congress were photographed wearing an AR-15-shaped rifle pin: U.S.Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., and Rep. Ana Paulina Luna, R-Fla. The lapels were spotted by Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif.: As The Daily Beast reported , this was not the first time that such a pin appeared on a U.S representative. Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., had been photographed with the pin in June 2021 . In a later tweet, Clyde took credit for their 2023 appearance, announcing on Twitter that he handed the AR-15 pins out, and that he had plenty to spare: Clyde is the owner of a gun store in his home state of Georgia. As reported by the Washington Post, the AR-15 pins were not the first weapons-based souvenir promoted by some GOP members of the 118th Congress: Clyde's distribution of the gun-shaped pins comes after newly elected Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) passed out dummy grenades stamped with the GOP logo last week to other members of Congress, along with a note on his office letterhead emphasizing that the ordnance was made in Florida. Because the photograph is genuine, the claim is ""True.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,222
61a924fc-cea4-4029-9634-e96999d50669,"In 2007, Former U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi instituted a ban on smoking in the Capitol, announcing that ""the days of smoke-filled rooms in the United States Capitol are over."" That ban, in essence, brought the Capitol in line with public smoking bans instituted around the country at the time. As The New York Times explained in 2007, this ban did not affect smoking in a Representative's office, but did affect a classically smoke-filled room known as the Speaker's Lobby. Lawmakers can still smoke in their individual offices, but they can no longer light up in the ornate hallway outside the House chamber known as the Speaker's Lobby, the spot where lawmakers often gather to talk with each other and with journalists. Most other areas of the Capitol, including the public areas outside the Senate, had already banned smoking. At the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, the Republican-controlled House reversed this ban, allowing smoking in public portions of the capitol excluding the House floor. Reports of increased tobacco smoke at the start of the 118th Congress appear to stem, at least in part , from the fact that Rep. Tom Cole — an avid cigar smoker — had moved into an office near the house press gallery. For example, Reuters reporter Patricia Zengerle tweeted that ""there's indoor smoking on the House side of the Capitol now that the Republicans have taken control."" Another Reuters reporter suggested that the new odors were cigars because Rep. Cole ""evidently loves cigars."" Following these observations, several news outlets suggested the practice of politicians like Cole smoking in their office was a result of that policy change. However, there has never been a ban on smoking in a House member's own office, even under the Pelosi ban. While it is factual that a smoking ban instituted by Pelosi was overturned , that reversal did not affect the presence of office smoking. Because, however, a ban instituted by House Democrats in 2007 was overturned by House Republicans in 2023, the claim is ""True.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,388

          Tax Relief










WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-GA) today introduced H.R. 25, the Fair Tax Act, to replace the current tax code with a national consumption tax known as the Fair Tax.

“Cosponsoring this Georgia-made legislation was my first act as a Member of Congress and is, fittingly, the first bill I am introducing in the 118th Congress,” said Rep. Buddy Carter. “Instead of adding 87,000 new agents to weaponize the IRS against small business owners and middle America, this bill will eliminate the need for the department entirely by simplifying the tax code with provisions that work for the American people and encourage growth and innovation. Armed, unelected bureaucrats should not have more power over your paycheck than you do.”

Joining Rep. Carter as original cosponsors are Reps. Andrew Clyde (R-GA), Jeff Duncan (R-SC), Kat Cammack (R-FL), Scott Perry (R-PA), Bob Good (R-VA), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Ralph Norman (R-SC), Bill Posey (R-FL), Gary Palmer (R-AL), Jim Banks (R-IN), and Barry Loudermilk (R-GA).


“As a former small business owner, I understand the unnecessary burden our failing income tax system has on Americans. The Fair Tax Act eliminates the tax code, replaces the income tax with a sales tax, and abolishes the abusive Internal Revenue Service. If enacted, this will invigorate the American taxpayer and help more Americans achieve the American Dream,” said Rep. Jeff Duncan.

“I support the Fair Tax because it simplifies our tax code. This transforms the U.S. tax code from a mandatory, progressive, and convoluted system to a fully transparent and unbiased system which does away with the IRS as we know it. It is good for our economy because it encourages work, savings, and investment. Thank you to my colleague Rep. Buddy Carter for leading this effort to simplify the system for American taxpayers,” said Rep. Bob Good.

“I’m very proud to once again co-sponsor the FairTax Act,” said Rep. Kat Cammack. “We’ve seen a continued growth of the IRS and a persistent punishment of hardworking Americans via the tax code. What we’re calling for is a simplified and fair code that works for all, not just some. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation that fights back against the weaponization of the IRS and stops punishing those who work hard to succeed.”

First introduced into the U.S. Congress in 1999 by former Georgia Congressman John Linder, the Fair Tax is the leading tax reform movement in the country. In addition to eliminating all personal and corporate income taxes, the death tax, gift taxes, and the payroll tax, the Fair Tax would also eliminate the need for the Internal Revenue Service. The Fair Tax would repeal the current tax code and replace it with a single national consumption tax that is pro-growth and allows Americans to keep every cent of their hard-earned money. It is the only tax system that is simple, efficient, friendly to economic growth, non-discriminatory, unintrusive, and FAIR.

00e68c9a-c8a2-4091-8991-51eac520fd49,"In early January 2023, as Republican U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy suffered numerous vote losses in his quest to become speaker of the House, where his party held a slim majority, Mitch McConnell, his counterpart in the Senate and minority leader, broke the record as the longest-serving senator in the chamber's history. Republicans remained divided on McCarthy as House speaker due to a small but vocal group on the far right. Meanwhile, as of this writing, former U.S. President Donald Trump was attempting to divert Republican ire toward McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao, using anti-Asian rhetoric to refer to the latter. In a post on TruthSocial on Jan. 4, 2023, he wrote: ""we ought to be fighting Mitch McConnell and his domineering, China loving BOSS, I mean wife, Coco Chow. The harm they have done to the Republican Party is incalculable."" We noticed, however, that back in 2018 all of these parties appeared to be on the same page. A photograph of McCarthy and Chao, who was then -U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the Trump administration and who was speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, made the rounds on the internet. This photograph is authentic. The panel they were speaking on was titled "" Strategic Outlook: United States "" and was moderated by Gerard Baker, who was editor-at-large at The Wall Street Journal. They were joined by Kirstjen Neilsen, then-U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security. The full panel can be found here , and you can see a screenshot of it below: (Screenshot via World Economic Forum) At the time, McCarthy was serving as House majority leader. In the panel, around the 2:34 mark, he mentioned having dinner at the house of Klaus Schwab, the chairperson of the WEF. ""You've got to understand what does 'America First' mean,"" McCarthy said in the talk. ""We wanted to focus on the economics of America, we want the citizens to be safe at home and abroad. ""As I sat around Klaus' dinner last night, what's interesting is the number of countries who are now talking about their tax system,"" he continued , explaining the reasoning behind Trumps' ""America First"" slogan. ""With doing something as big as the tax change [...] the economics of America rising helps the rest of the world. It also helps from a safety perspective around the world."" After the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Chao criticized Trump and resigned from her position. In late 2022, Trump also blamed her and McConnell for the ""turmoil"" in the Republican party, while continuing to use racist language against her. McConnell, meanwhile, appeared alongside Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden in early January 2023 to promote bipartisan efforts to improve infrastructure. While much of his career has been spent stymying the Democratic agenda, McConnell was increasingly criticizing Trump and shifting toward promoting a more bipartisan image. We therefore rate the above claim as a ""True.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,575

43ca3320-f391-4373-b574-7647c46a2bef,"Screenshots supposedly showing statements by former U.S. President Donald Trump about House Republicans' vote to elect a speaker circulated widely on Jan. 4, 2023. In the statements, Trump endorsed Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the leadership position. The screenshots indeed depicted authentic statements by the former president. He shared them on his social media platform, Truth Social, after McCarthy failed to secure enough support from members of his own party in multiple rounds of voting on Jan. 3. Considering those facts, we rate this claim ""True."" In the early hours of Jan. 4, Trump wrote on Truth Social, ""Some really good conversations took place last night, and it's now time for all of our GREAT Republican House Members to VOTE FOR KEVIN, CLOSE THE DEAL, TAKE THE VICTORY, & WATCH CRAZY NANCY PELOSI FLY BACK HOME TO A VERY BROKEN CALIFORNIA,THE ONLY SPEAKER IN U.S. HISTORY TO HAVE LOST THE ""HOUSE"" TWICE! REPUBLICANS, DO NOT TURN A GREAT TRIUMPH INTO A GIANT & EMBARRASSING DEFEAT. IT'S TIME TO CELEBRATE, YOU DESERVE IT. Kevin McCarthy will do a good job, and maybe even a GREAT JOB - JUST WATCH!"" While Trump had backed McCarthy publicly before, on Jan. 3, the first day of voting, his enthusiasm appeared to wane . In an interview with NBC News, Trump declined to reiterate his support for McCarthy as House speaker, saying, ""We'll see how it all works out."" Then, on Jan. 4, that stance shifted with the above-displayed Truth Social post. (Roughly 20 minutes after posting the endorsement, Trump posted again , urging Republicans turn their ire to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.) While Trump's post supporting McCarthy for House speaker was indeed an official statement from the former president, less accurate — or completely fake — screenshots supposedly showing his posts or press releases are quite popular on social media. For example, we've previously covered fake statements that supposedly showed Trump calling Mike Pence a ""dog,"" insulting Joe Rogan, responding to Biden's COVID-19 diagnosis, and criticizing Liz Cheney . Some of McCarthy's most vocal opponents remain loyal to Trump. Another vote for House speaker will be held on Jan. 4. McCarthy made several concessions to appease lawmakers who did not vote for him initially. — This report includes contributions from the Snopes staff.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,446
4eacfa54-96b9-4efc-a5b6-4e0a8edf5a8d,"In early December 2022, we received inquiries from readers who asked if it was true that former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration had previously agreed to an exchange that released 5,000 Taliban prisoners. They also wanted to know if Trump had at one time planned to invite Taliban leaders to Camp David. We soon found that all of this was true. Both of these old news items made a comeback on social media following the Dec. 8, 2022, release of WNBA star Brittney Griner. Griner was freed from a Russian prison in exchange for the U.S. releasing ""notorious Russian arms dealer"" Viktor Bout, The Associated Press reported . Some social media users pointed to the previous Taliban prisoner exchange and Camp David plans that occurred under Trump, while at the same time critics of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration decried the deal made that freed Bout. In this story, we're going to look at the facts behind the claim that 5,000 Taliban prisoners were exchanged. We'll also examine the prior news of plans for a Camp David summit. The Origins of the Rumors According to the Austin American-Statesman and PolitiFact, both of these claims appeared to have first gained some prominence after U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, mentioned them. On Aug. 29, 2021, during Biden's first year in the White House, Romney appeared on CNN and blamed both Trump and Biden for the way the final years went down with the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan. Just three days prior to when the interview aired, as the U.S. was completing its withdrawal from Afghanistan, a single suicide bomber killed at least 60 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Romney referenced the attack during the interview with CNN's Jake Tapper: If you focus on, gosh, what should we do right now, recognize that we're in the position we're in right now because of terrible decisions made by two administrations. One, the Trump administration negotiating directly with the Taliban, getting ready to invite them to Camp David, opening up a prison of 5,000 Taliban and probably ISIS-K individuals, and letting them free. I mean, we don't know whether some of them were involved in the attack that occurred. These were the decisions that led to what you're seeing and the danger that existed at the airport. This should not have happened. President Biden closing the Bagram air base. That's what's led to what's happening. 5,000 Taliban Prisoners Exchanged On Aug. 30, 2021, VerifyThis.com published a fact check about the Taliban prisoner exchange with a well-sourced report. They also rated ""True"" the fact that the Trump administration agreed to the exchange. One of the sources cited in the reporting was a U.S. Department of State document titled, ""Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban and the United States of America."" It was dated Feb. 29, 2020, which was at the beginning of the final year of the Trump administration. There were a few components in the agreement, several of which sought assurances to keep the U.S. and its allies safe from retaliation. To keep things brief, here's the part of the agreement that's relevant to this story, which said that 5,000 Taliban prisoners would be exchanged for up to 1,000 prisoners ""of the other side"": The United States is committed to start immediately to work with all relevant sides on a plan to expeditiously release combat and political prisoners as a confidence building measure with the coordination and approval of all relevant sides. Up to five thousand (5,000) prisoners of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban and up to one thousand (1,000) prisoners of the other side will be released by March 10, 2020, the first day of intra-Afghan negotiations, which corresponds to Rajab 15, 1441 on the Hijri Lunar calendar and Hoot 20, 1398 on the Hijri Solar calendar. The relevant sides have the goal of releasing all the remaining prisoners over the course of the subsequent three months. The United States commits to completing this goal. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban commits that its released prisoners will be committed to the responsibilities mentioned in this agreement so that they will not pose a threat to the security of the United States and its allies. At the time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the agreement an ""historic opportunity."" VerifyThis.com noted that, ""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed the agreement, although warned the U.S. must be vigilant in dealing with the Taliban."" Additionally, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the agreement ""an important initial step toward advancing security and stability in Afghanistan,"" adding that, ""many significant additional steps remain to achieve comprehensive and enduring peace."" The reporting also pointed to a Congressional Research Service document that was published months after Trump left office. It was dated June 11, 2021, weeks prior to the attacks at the airport in Kabul, and said, ""The prisoner exchange was completed in early September 2020."" Trump was still in the White House at the time. The document included a key part, which read, ""Talks between the two sides continue but have not made substantial progress and remain complicated by a number of factors."" This indicated that the Taliban prisoners were released without both sides agreeing to terms. Taliban Leaders to Camp David In Romney's answer on CNN, he also referenced the Trump administration's prior plans to invite Taliban leaders to Camp David. On Sept. 7, 2019, about one year before the Taliban prisoners were all freed, Trump himself tweeted a small thread about the plans, saying that the Taliban leaders were going to ""secretly meet"" with him at Camp David on Sept. 8, just three days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. This raised eyebrows, as the Taliban had previously ""forged a close relationship"" with al-Qaida, the terrorist group that carried out the attacks , according to Brittanica.com . The three tweets from Trump read as follows: Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to.. ....an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations. What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? They didn't, they.... ....only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don't have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight? Trump's tweets said that the meeting with Taliban leaders at Camp David was planned, but had been canceled before it took place.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1369
500a1b4e-cf9b-479c-8da4-31a5db9917e9,"Since the 2020 elections, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has attacked U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, for allegedly engaging in business practices by means of which Hunter allegedly benefited from his father's position. But just a few years ago, according to an internet rumor, Carlson was asking for the younger Biden's help in getting his son into college. A meme going around claims that an email shows Carlson thanking Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown University on behalf of his son, Buckley. This claim is accurate. In 2014, when Joe Biden was serving as vice president, Carlson and his wife, Susie, reached out to Hunter Biden for help in getting their son into Georgetown University. Their email communication was revealed through forensic analysis of a laptop once owned by Biden that he had purportedly left at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019. The laptop was obtained by Trump's then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and its contents pushed out to the New York Post in 2020. The correspondence on Biden's hard drive, a copy of which was also in the possession of the FBI, was largely used to investigate his overseas business dealings during his father's time in the White House, but also have illuminated more about the Carlson-Biden relationship. The emails were given to The Washington Post on a hard drive by activist Jack Maxey, who received it from Giuliani. The Washington Post revealed the details of Carlson's and Biden's communication in May 2022, and was able to confirm with the help of forensic analysis and interviews with people familiar with the communications that this and other emails on the hard drive were real. So what did Carlson actually say? The Post shared an image of a few of the emails in which he thanks Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown ""on Buckley's [his son's] behalf."" He added, ""So nice of you. I know it'll help."" Image via Washington Post Carlson's wife wrote to Biden in 2014: ""I realize you don't really know Buckley. Maybe you could meet or speak to him and he could send you a very brief resume with his interests and grades attached."" She also wrote: ""Tucker and I would be so grateful if you could write a letter or speak to someone in the Georgetown Admission's Office about Buckley."" Biden wrote back that he would be honored to help. ""I will do anything you would like me to do,"" he said. Carlson described his son's interest in squash and fly fishing and wrote, ""He loves Washington for all the right reasons, I think, and really wants to go to school here."" When Biden agreed to write a letter for Buckley, Susie responded with, ""Tucker and I have the greatest respect and admiration for you. Always!"" Carlson admitted that he was once close with Biden in a phone interview with the Post. He said: ""Hunter Biden was my neighbor. Our wives were friends. I knew him well. I talked to him many times about addiction, something I know a lot about. And I've said that. I think that Hunter Biden is an addict and that's why his life is falling apart, and I feel bad for him. I've said that many times, and I mean it."" He refused to discuss the emails, however, pointing (with apparent irony) to claims that the timing of the laptop's emergence in 2020 had the hallmarks of Russian disinformation. Previously, Carlson had dismissed and mocked claims of a Russian disinformation campaign as an effort by the establishment and tech giants to protect Joe Biden's 2020 election campaign. It is unclear if Biden ended up writing a letter, but Carlson's son did end up going to the University of Virginia. ""I can't confirm these emails. The emails that you're referring to were described by our intel community as Russian disinformation,"" he said . He added that he could not verify the emails as he did not have access to the account. Hunter Biden declined to comment to the Post. Since 2020, Carlson has regularly skewered the younger Biden on his show, accusing him of getting ""lucrative jobs … because he had an important father."" He did say there were certain lines he would not cross, pertaining to the laptop. In October 2020, he said: ""Much of the material on the laptop is of limited relevance to the public. [...] And by the way, if we're being honest, some of the exchanges between Hunter Biden and his father, and they are on there, too, reveal that whatever you say about them, Joe Biden really loves his son, and they're touching."" But following the 2020 election, Carlson's anti-Hunter Biden rhetoric grew , and he even poked fun at his addictions in an October 2021 segment: ""So again, let's say you were a crackhead through your 40s, made a lot of pornographic videos mostly of yourself, your genitals covered in M&Ms, and then once you got to your 50s, decide, 'Hey, I want to be Andy Warhol. You probably couldn't do it unless your dad happened to be the president, and that's how Hunter Biden pulled that off.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1015
1d72f37c-b074-4e7f-be6a-2083ffa98d88,"In September 2022, a Twitter user posted that flyers were available at a rally held for former U.S. President Donald Trump that named him as ""the son of man"" and ""the Christ."" It was true that the flyers showed the cover of a real, published book from author Helgard Müller, titled, ""President Donald J. Trump, The Son of Man - The Christ."" Müller confirmed to us via the Messenger app that he personally handed the flyers out at the most recent Trump rally in Youngstown, Ohio, which took place on Sept. 17. ""I did hand the flyers out. I gave them to the people in line. Some were sitting,"" he said. We also asked him if anyone with Trump's campaign or team had ever handed out the flyers in any official capacity. ""No,"" he answered. (We were notified by Courier-Journal columnist Joe Gerth that the picture of the flyer in the tweet was taken by him in Kentucky on Sept. 10.) Posts on Müller's Facebook page showed that he traveled with a trailer (the small one below) and some signage to help promote his book at Trump rallies. The book 's release appeared to have been around March 2022. ""Is this satire?,"" a Facebook commenter asked . ""Nope,"" Müller answered. ""The real deal."" Another Facebook commenter asked for an explanation, posting, ""What!!?? Trump...The Christ? Are you pulling our leg?"" Müller provided an answer by pointing to his interpretation of Bible verses, saying he believed the son of God to be Jesus Christ , and the son of man to be Trump, meaning he believed there to be two Christs: You know that Jesus, the Son of God always spoke about the Son of MAN in a third person? ""For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words (Jesus, the Son of God), of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels."" Have you not notice how Jesus, the Son of God spoke in the first person about himself and always referred to the Son of MAN in the third person? Müller also told us that he believed there to be a comparison between Jesus being betrayed by Judas and Trump purportedly being ""betrayed by Pence,"" purportedly referring to the former U.S. vice president's decision to follow the U.S. Constitution rather than overturning the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election based on conspiracy theories. (In reality, no credible evidence of massive voter fraud has ever been produced to show that the election was ""stolen,"" as Trump often claimed.) Following the Ohio rally, Müller uploaded a video that provided a longer explanation as to why he believed Trump to be ""the son of man"" and ""the Christ,"" as mentioned on the cover of his book. ""Don't get offended. Don't say, 'Ew, that's blasphemous,'"" he said. ""Jesus is the king of the Jews. Trump is the king of kings."" In sum, yes, it's true that flyers were being handed out at a Trump rally for a book that called Trump ""the son of God"" and ""the Christ.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,644
fe157973-7da9-4f49-8698-ccf276a1df4e,"In October 2021, social media posts and news outlets reported that the new Ohio license plate, whose design Gov. Mike DeWine had just unveiled, contained a notable historical inaccuracy. For example, one Twitter user wrote, ""Holy shit. The Wright Brothers Flyer is flying backwards on the new Ohio license plate,"" while Axios reporter Tyler Buchanan wrote, ""That tail-looking thing is actually the front. But the banner's facing the other way."" The unveiling of the new license plate design, at a news conference on Oct. 21, can be watched below. Among other features, the plate contains a banner that reads ""Birthplace of Aviation"" emerging from a representation of the Flyer — the ground-breaking aircraft designed by Dayton, Ohio, brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright, which made the first ever airplane flight in 1903. https://youtu.be/xDABUXKeqiA?t=582 In the design unveiled at the news conference, the banner emerged from the smaller end of the Flyer, giving the impression that this was the back of the aircraft. This was evident in a tweet posted by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) : However, that smaller end of the Wright Flyer, composed of the ""elevators,"" was actually at the front , as this National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) graphic shows: So tweeted photos and other descriptions of the originally unveiled license plate design — showing the banner emerging from the smaller end of the aircraft — were authentic, and social media users were right to point out that that representation was indeed inaccurate. As such, we are issuing a rating of ""True."" However, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) promptly acknowledged the error and issued a new design version of the license plate later on the same day, which correctly showed the banner emerging from the back end of the aircraft: A spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Public Safety told Snopes that around 35,000 license plates had already been manufactured with the error featured on them, but said the state would be recycling all of them. The spokesperson said it was not yet clear what the cost would be of having to re-print those license plates with the corrected design.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,414
8769b11a-5339-4f85-a1a5-3faea2443b98,"In September 2021, a photograph started to circulate on social media that supposedly showed U.S. President Joe Biden and a group of children wearing hats, shirts, and other memorabilia featuring slogans for former President Donald Trump. This image was widely circulated on social media by those claiming that Biden had been ""punked"" by the kids, or that the president had been tricked into taking a photograph with children wearing Trump memorabilia. The @RealDonaldTrump Gab account — an account that reposts emailed statements from the former president since Trump has been banned by more popular social media networks — shared the image along with the caption: ""These kids tricked Biden just like the Taliban did."" This is a genuine photograph of Biden with several children wearing Trump memorabilia. However, there's no evidence to support the claim that the president was ""tricked"" into taking this photo. In fact, Biden referenced this photograph as an example of unity and a social media account that appears to belong to one of the children featured in this image stated that Biden was aware of the hats. The child wrote on Instagram: ""Yes [he was aware of the hats] he actually said “I believe in liking people even if they don’t like you. This photograph was taken on Sept. 11, 2021, in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, during an event to commemorate 9/11. Biden referenced this photograph as an example of unity after he was asked by a reporter what he had been thinking during the 20th anniversary of 9/11 . Biden's full response hit on a number of different topics. He talked about a friend of his who lost a son during the attack and the heroism of the passengers of United Flight 93. Biden also praised the remarks delivered earlier by former President George W. Bush regarding the forces that were dividing the country, and then talked about meeting the children in the viral photograph who were wearing memorabilia for his former political rival. Biden said: I thought that President Bush made a really good speech today — genuinely good speech — about who we are. We’re not — the core of who we are is not divided. It’s just this notion of — I don’t know how to explain it. I think, Jeff, I talked to you a little about this. I think the real issue for those kids that — just had a picture taken with — couple of them had Trump hats from last year — I think, for them, it’s going to be: Are we going to, in the next 4, 5, 6, 10 years, demonstrate that democracies can work, or not? [...] There’s a lot of autocrats who truly believe that democracies can’t function in the 21st century. Not a joke. They think because the world is changing so rapidly and people are so divided, you can’t bring people together in a democracy to get a consensus, and the only ones that are going to be able to succeed are the autocrats. That’s why it’s so damn important we demonstrate — everybody says, “Biden, why do you keep insisting on trying to bring the country together?” That’s the thing that’s going to affect our wellbeing more than anything else: how the rest of the world responds to us — knowing that we actually can, in fact, lead by the example of our power again.

Demand for oil continues to fall due to the new coronavirus outbreak. As demand for fuel plummeted worldwide and the oil industry faced a devastating drop in oil prices, the U.S. took the rare move of stepping into negotiations involving the member countries of OPEC and non-members such as Russia and Mexico. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)NEW YORK (AP) — As demand for fuel plummeted worldwide and the oil industry faced a devastating drop in oil prices, the U.S. took the rare move of stepping into negotiations involving the member countries of OPEC and non-members such as Russia and Mexico, an alliance called OPEC+.President Donald Trump and a group of U.S. senators wielded political influence to push OPEC and its allies to agree over the weekend to cut production by nearly 10 million barrels per day — about 10% of current global output.The unusual action by the U.S. — and the fact that the intervention worked — reflect the desperate conditions the oil industry found itself in due to the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus outbreak. “There have been oil market crises, but nothing like this before,” said Dan Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. “Even when the price collapsed in 1986 or 1988, demand actually went up. You’ve never had a 20 to 25% drop in demand just overnight. You’ve never had the world economy shut down overnight.”Trump also knew what was at stake domestically — The U.S. is now the world’s largest oil and gas producer.“This historic action will help nearly 11 million American workers who are supported by the U.S. oil and gas industry,” Trump said during a coronavirus press briefing Monday. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THE U.S. INVOLVEMENT? American officials have gotten involved with OPEC in the past, making phone calls or attempting to sway a deal during international crises and unusual circumstances. The intervention has typically been in response to high prices; instead, in the current situation, oil prices dropped more than 60% since the start of the year. “There is nothing new about a president phoning Riyadh to ask for help dealing with oil market disruptions, but the level of pressure and deep involvement of both sides of Pennsylvania Ave., not to mention the G20, along with the scale of the oil cuts on the table, is something rarely seen in OPEC history,” said Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.WHAT EXACTLY DID THE U.S. BRING TO THE TABLE?Mexico stalled the negotiations by refusing to cut more than 100,000 barrels a day of production, when OPEC was asking for double or triple that amount. Trump said the U.S. would help by shouldering the cuts that Mexico was unwilling to make. While Trump’s promise to help Mexico may have seemed hollow — U.S. companies were already cutting production due to the low prices — Trump’s intervention on Mexico’s behalf sent a message that could have helped push the wary alliance into a deal.“They had to agree to give something like a cover story, a diplomatic cover, so that the other parties in OPEC, who whether they liked it or not were going to have to accept these terms, would be able to do so without a loss of prestige,” said Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners.Trump’s statements also signaled that the U.S. views Mexico as an important partner in the integrated North American energy market, said Amy Myers Jaffe, senior fellow at the Council for Foreign Relations, who also saw it as an important policy move. “I think it will serve the president well on every count,” including border issues, she said.Even more stark was a call between a dozen U.S. senators and high-ranking energy and defense officials Saturday. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, noted there is legislation drafted that would remove American forces, including Patriot Missile batteries, from Saudi Arabia. “If they lose that group of senators you start to see veto override majorities on legislation that deals negatively with the Saudis,” Sullivan told a small group of congressional reporters.That was a very clear threat, Book said. “It’s not really a negotiation at all.” he added. “It’s a pretty dangerous neighborhood for the Saudis, and the U.S. plays a vital role in protecting them.”COULD FORCED PRODUCTION CUTS WORK IN THE U.S.? With state-run oil operations, OPEC nations can easily enact a cut or boost production. But the U.S. has thousands of independent oil producers, so coordinating and enforcing a production cut would be complicated, and experts say it’s unlikely.Some oil producers in Texas and Oklahoma are pushing for state-mandated production cuts, but the industry is split on the prospect. Right now, the producers with more costly production are most likely to suffer, and would be the first to file for bankruptcy or shut down existing wells, damaging oil fields. But a state-managed production cut “spreads out the pain uniformly,” Book said. “We’re not suggesting that Oklahoma can balance the market, we can’t do that,” said Mike Cantrell, owner of Cantrell Investments LLC, an oil and gas investment group based in Oklahoma. But statewide, production has declined about 20% this year, the equivalent of about 100,000 barrels a day — a cut similar to Mexico’s. If sustained, “that would be a cut that would be a significant cut in the world scheme of things,” he said. In Texas, commissioners will hold a meeting Tuesday on the topic. WHY DIDN’T OIL PRICES RECOVER AFTER THE OPEC+ DEAL?Despite the deal, U.S. benchmark crude was trading at about $22 a barrel Monday, well below what most producers need to financially survive. But that was still better than what some analysts had predicted — including a drop in the price to the single digits.“A clock was ticking, for all the players, because by the end of April or early May...the world was going to run out of storage, and the price of oil was going to drop like a rock,” Yergin said.WHAT ABOUT LOW FUEL PRICES?Low oil prices lead to cheap gasoline prices, and consumers in different times would praise discounts at the pump. Gasoline prices are about $1.86 per gallon, about $1 less than a year ago, according to AAA. But most consumers aren’t able to take advantage, because many are staying home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Even when travel restrictions lift, economic turmoil could prompt consumers to save money and stay home.___AP Writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.Follow Bussewitz on Twitter: @cbussewitz AP NEWSTop StoriesVideoContact UsAccessibility StatementCookie SettingsDownload AP NEWSConnect with the definitive source for global and local newsMore from APap.orgAP InsightsAP Definitive Source BlogAP Images SpotlightAP ExploreAP BooksAP StylebookFollow APThe Associated PressAboutContactCustomer SupportCareersTerms & ConditionsPrivacyAll contents © copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

942f66b0-4727-46bf-bfa5-01c8d3144131,"Fact Check Former U.S President Jimmy Carter was considered to be ahead of his time on issues surrounding climate change, exemplified by his installation of solar panels on the rooftop of the White House in the 1970s. Years later, Reagan removed the panels when he came into power, and they returned decades after, during the Obama administration. Some sources have reported that the solar panels installed by Obama are still in place. We are in the process of verifying that. A photograph of Carter showing off the panels he had installed at a dedication ceremony in 1979 was popular on Reddit in September 2022: The above caption does correctly state that Carter displayed the solar panels to guests at the White House, but it's incorrect as to when Carter’s successor, President Ronald Reagan, had the panels removed. Carter had 32 panels installed there, and for seven years they were used to heat water in the household until the Reagan administration removed them in 1986 -- not two years later as the post claims. According to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History , which now has one of the original panels in its collection, they were a symbol of Carter’s faith in “the power of the sun.” The above photograph is taken from the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library collection, and was published in The New York Times and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution . The same image can be seen on Britannica . The New York Times' caption stated: “In 1979, President Carter showed off new solar panels on the West Wing that would provide hot water for the White House.” Various shots from that event are available in the National Archives catalog , and shots of that particular moment can be seen in the bottom half of the photographic film scans. These photographs were taken at the White House dedication event for the solar panels. Jimmy Carter Presidential Library At the ceremony, which was held in June 1979, Carter said : In the year 2000 this solar water heater behind me, which is being dedicated today, will still be here supplying cheap, efficient energy [...] A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people. Other photographs from the same event show the panels more clearly displayed on the rooftop of the White House's Cabinet Room, which is where the dedication event appears to take place. Jimmy Carter Presidential Library What happened to those panels after they were removed? According to Scientific American , one ended up at the National Museum of American History, one is in the Carter Library, and one is at the Solar Science and Technology Museum in Dezhou, China. Solar panels made a comeback at the White House during former President George W. Bush's tenure in 2002, but not on the Executive Mansion's roof. According to the White House Historical Association , the National Park Service oversaw installation of three solar energy systems on the White House grounds starting in 2002. The installation during his tenure helped heat up the White House swimming pool. In 2010, then-U.S. President Barack Obama announced that solar panels would once again be installed on the White House rooftop. The installation was completed in 2014 . The video below highlights the process: We reached out to the White House Historical Association to learn if any updates or changes were made to the panels during the Trump administration. They shared with us a photograph from a July 2021 news article in which the panels are still visible, stating, ""It appears from photographers that the panels are still installed on the roof."" While they confirmed that the panels are still there, they could not verify with certainty if the Trump administration had made any changes to them before 2020.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,727
afe8ecb3-9e61-43d6-8a24-c4c23c88299b,"A photograph that's frequently shared online appears to show a younger Hillary Clinton, perhaps back in her days as U.S. first lady, playing a Game Boy while seated on a flight. Was the picture altered? Was Clinton perhaps originally using an old Palm PDA (personal digital assistant) or something else before someone doctored the photo with Adobe Photoshop? The answer to those two questions is no. The truth is that Clinton was authentically photographed while playing a Game Boy. The picture was captured by photographer Ralph Alswang on April 20, 2015. It was posted to Instagram by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library & Museum, which was named for her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton. The Instagram caption read, ""April 6, 1993: Hillary Rodham Clinton plays a Nintendo ""Game Boy"" electronic game on her flight from Austin, Texas to Washington, DC. Photographed by Ralph Alswang. #NARA #Nintendo #GameBoy #Videogames #ClintonCenter #ClintonLibrary #PresidentialLibraries #HRC #FirstLady."" The original Game Boy required four AA batteries. It's unclear if Clinton carried extras. On May 24, 1993, Carol Jouzaitis with Chicago Tribune reported that the Game Boy belonged to Clinton's daughter, Chelsea. We don't know what game Clinton was playing since the angle of the photograph obscured the title on the cartridge. However, two good guesses would be Super Mario Land and Tetris. The games were included in some of the bundles that were packaged with the original Game Boy. On July 19, 1994, Sara Williams reported for the News-Press in Fort Myers, Florida, that she did some digging in an attempt to find out what games Clinton enjoyed the most: She's dressed to the nines. Her hair is done to perfection in one of the 15 styles she wears. She's kicked off her shoes. The most powerful man in the free world rubs her toes. Faxes, dispatches, and telephone calls are on hold as she wings her way to Europe on Air Force One. She needs to unwind. So what does she choose? Game Boy. ""I've become fond of Game Boy,"" she recently told Redbook magazine. Yes, Hillary Clinton loves video games. … So I called up the White House to find out exactly what games Hillary Clinton plays on which machines, only to learn that this is a state secret. ""If we said what Mrs. Clinton likes to play, it could be considered an endorsement,"" said a press aide. It could also be an embarrassment. ""Tetris,"" after all, was invented in Russia at least 15 years ago, quite possibly as a sop to the hungry and disgruntled masses who had no access to the goods. Clinton later went on to serve as a U.S. senator for the state of New York and as secretary of state under former U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2016, she was nominated as the Democratic Party's candidate for president.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,563
b8479148-de52-4e21-98e1-e01573248d6c,"It's true that film actor Tommy Lee Jones and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore were roommates in college. Gore, a leading climate activist and a former Democratic presidential candidate in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, first met Jones on the campus of Harvard College in 1965. Jones has won awards for his roles in numerous films, perhaps most notably his best supporting actor Oscar for the 1994 film ""The Fugitive,"" which starred Harrison Ford in the leading role. College Days In 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton was elected to his first presidential term. Gore was his running mate. Prior to Election Day, The Associated Press ran a story headlined, ""Tipper Gore: A One-Time Motorcycle Mamma."" The article told the story of the days when the two roommates would cause a bit of trouble and make a run from the police: BOSTON (AP) — Tipper Gore likens the Democratic presidential campaign bus tour to a double date with Bill and Hillary Clinton, but not so daring as double dates in college. She, Al Gore, and their friends would pile onto one motorcycle and turn down narrow alleys to ditch the police. ""I would get up on the handlebars, and then there would be Al, and then there would be my roommate, and then there would be Tommy Lee Jones,"" Mrs. Gore said during a visit to the city where she went to college. Tommy Lee Jones became an actor, Al Gore became the Democrats' vice presidential nominee and Mrs. Gore returned to her alma mater, Boston University, this week to stump for the Clinton presidential campaign. 'One of My Closest Friends' While serving as Clinton's vice president for two terms, Gore set his sights on the presidency. In 2000, he won the Democratic primary for president. At the time, multiple newspapers published the fact that Jones and Gore were roommates during their time at Harvard College. That August, Jones spoke briefly about his friend in front of a crowd at the Democratic National Convention, calling Gore one of his ""closest friends."" Jones' Convention Speech The speech in Los Angeles began like this: Al Gore has been one of my closest friends since the day we met on the first day of college 35 years ago. There are plenty of people at this convention who can and will speak to big policy questions, but I have one very real issue to talk about. One I can probably address as well as anyone outside the Gore family. And that is the quality of this man's character. He is a good, caring, loving man. I know 35 different people at least who have known Al Gore for 35 years at least and I know that every single one of them will tell you the same thing. I lived with him for four years, and what did we do? We shot pool and we watched ""Star Trek"" when maybe we should have been studying for exams. He'd challenge me to shooting contests. We'd see who can hit a tin can from the farthest away, and I tell you, it was usually Al. My parents lived overseas when I was in college, and the Gore home in Carthage was always open to me. When I visited Al in middle Tennessee, we did the complicated things you'd expect college kids to do. We'd catch a loose cow, go canoeing and hunting, and chasing through the woods with coon dogs in the middle of the night. One time in college, neither of us could make it home for Thanksgiving, so we made a fire in the venerable old fireplace in our room and we wrapped a big turkey in a couple of rolls of tin foil and rustled it right there in the dorm. I know from Tipper that that has been some of the most ambitious cooking that Albert has done since then. And there were serious times too. We were all affected by the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and our country's tragic involvement in southeast Asia. I remember how Al struggled to hold on to his faith at a time when it seemed like America was losing its way. And I can tell you, Al Gore never did lose faith in America. Jones' speech continued with various remembrances about his former college roommate, including a moment when he said of Gore, ""Al is the closest thing I've had to a brother.""

9e664c6e-4723-4b91-acb5-6892cd642ede,"On Sept. 1, 2022, readers asked us whether a book teaching about gay sex was available on the shelves of a public middle school library in Tampa, Florida. For example, The Florida Standard reported , ""Book in Tampa Middle School Library Has Instructions on Anal Sex and Hookup Apps."" As of the writing of this story, we can report it was true that author Juno Dawson's book, ""This Book Is Gay,"" was available on the shelves of the Pierce Middle School library in Tampa . The school is part of Hillsborough County Public Schools, which is described as ""the 7th largest district in the United States."" It was also true that the book includes a chapter with information and instructions that teaches kids about anal sex, oral sex, and hookup apps. In this article, we've laid out all of the facts to help inform our readers about this subject. We've included a link to a school board meeting video, text from an advisory in the book, pictures of pages that were being discussed, further context, and answers from our correspondence with the school district. Board Meeting Speech On Aug. 31, Just The News reported that Will Witt, The Florida Standard's editor in chief, spoke at a school board meeting ""against the book being available in children's libraries."" The speech was tweeted on Witt's Twitter account on Aug. 30, the same day as the meeting. It has since been retweeted and liked thousands of times: Chapter Introduction One of the chapters that appeared to receive the most attention in the reporting from The Florida Standard and from social media users was titled, ""Chapter 9: The Ins and Outs of Gay Sex."" The chapter begins with the following advisory: This chapter is about sex. Therefore it has sex in it. WELL, DUH. If you are a younger reader and you feel you aren't ready for the finer details of same-sex pairings, then simply skip this whole chapter. HOWEVER, before you do, I'd like to remind you that we taught you all about straight sex when you were ELEVEN YEARS OLD during sixth grade. The fact that they didn't also teach you what same-sex couples do is nothing less than institutionalized homophobia. Straight sex was presented as the norm to make five percent of the population feel abnormal. Is there something icky about gay sex? Is there something wrong with it? I challenge any politician to discuss this with me. I WILL RUIN THEM. This chapter is simply all the stuff teachers SHOULD be saying if they want to be inclusive of people with same-sex feelings. We contacted the school district with several questions for our story. As part of one question, we mentioned the two bolded sentences above. In response, a spokesperson for the district told us that the quote ""is from a book that is not representative of our curriculum."" (More of their answers to our other questions are available near the end of this article.) 'The Ins and Outs of Gay Sex' Social media users shared pages from the book that taught about how to have anal sex and oral sex. The book also made mention of Grindr, a mobile app that provides sexual encounter opportunities (hookups) for men. We verified that all of these pages did come from Dawson's book, ""This Book Is Gay."" Sex Diagram Pages The Florida Standard and social media users also described a page in the book with a diagram of a naked boy. The diagram was titled as, ""Part One: Boy-On-Boy Sex."" We continued reading the chapter and found the next part to be titled, ""Part Two: Girl-On-Girl Sex."" It showed a diagram of a naked girl. However, none of the articles or social media posts that we reviewed included information that expressed any outrage about the second diagram, nor did they make any mention whatsoever about the part about girls having sex with each other. They only referenced the page about boys. Available in Three Schools According to online library data for the Florida school district, we were able to confirm that two copies of ""This Book Is Gay"" were indeed part of Pierce Middle School's library selection. The book also showed up as being listed at Middleton High School and Tampa Bay Technical High School, which were in the same district. ""This Book Is Gay"" showed up in three local schools, including Pierce Middle. Book Hasn't Been Officially Challenged By email, a spokesperson for Hillsborough County Public Schools told us that, as of Sept. 1, ""no one has officially challenged this book at any of the three schools where it is available."" We also inquired about the general policies that the district follows regarding challenging a book at a school library. In response, they provided the following information: We have a process that allows anyone to challenge a book they feel is inappropriate on the school level. Parents are encouraged to speak to their librarian first, who can then discuss the concerns, and the school's Educational Media Materials Committee can then convene to review the challenged material. Committee members then read or view the material in its entirety and consult professional review and academic resources to weigh the merits against alleged faults in light of the material as a whole. The committee then determines the extent to which the material meets the criteria for selection. They make an ultimate decision on whether the book will remain on the shelf at that school. The school district's website featured further documentation about its policies.

f86968df-1dfb-4759-9b99-2c6e13a5e5fd,"Fact Check On Aug. 25, 2022, the official Twitter account for the White House posted a tweet criticizing comments by U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., in which she stated her disagreement with the Biden administration's plan to forgive some federal student loan debt. In the video included in the tweet above, Greene used an appearance on right wing broadcaster Newsmax to opine that it's ""completely unfair"" to some taxpayers, namely those that didn't take out a student loan, to ""have to pay off the great big student loan debt"" of others. The White House's clap-back tweet was in reference to reports that Taylor Commercial, a construction company owned by Greene and her husband, received money through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The tactic has been used to attack other conservatives, although in the case of commentator Ben Shapiro, it backfired because he didn't get a $20,832 PPP loan, as some had claimed. U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) records show Greene's company accepted $182,300 in PPP loan money in April 2020, and that it was ""Paid in full or forgiven,"" which refers to loans ""repaid and those fully forgiven from repayment under PPP guidelines,"" per the SBA. A database of PPP loans provided by the nonprofit news outlet ProPublica, which obtained data from the SBA via public records, shows that Taylor Commercial had a total of $183,504 forgiven, including accrued interest. We reached out to Greene's office asking for comment on the controversy, and were provided a statement that didn't address the student loan/PPP loan discourse, but instead pointed to swatting incidents targeting Greene's home. ""It's a shame that [U.S. President] Joe Biden and his spokesmen in the media continue to make MTG a target simply because she is outspoken against Democrat policies, like genital mutilation surgeries for minors,"" the statement read, a likely reference to surgeries performed on some transgender people as part of gender affirming care (although such procedures are rarely performed on minors). There is important context to this controversy, namely that student loans and PPP loans are entirely different in their purpose and structure. PPP loans were given during the COVID-19 pandemic to businesses with the expectation that, if used as intended, they would be forgiven. Many businesses had no choice but to cease or curtail operations during the height of the pandemic, and the program was intended to prevent them from laying off workers or going under. Student loans, on the other hand, are sought by those seeking higher education and are taken out with the expectation that they will be paid back.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,500
74a08bb4-078d-4661-976a-dcae9efd626a,"Fact Check The 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) took place in Dallas, Texas, from Aug. 4-7, featuring Republican notables such as former U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Sen.

A digital banner displayed during one of those panel discussions became the subject of controversy when photographs and video clips of it went viral on social media. The banner read: ""We Are All Domestic Terrorists."" ""Conservative panelists at CPAC Dallas embraced a new label on Saturday,"" read a tweet by the Houston Chronicle, ""adopting 'domestic terrorist' as a badge of honor."" The banner -- actually, two banners -- can also be seen in the video clip below: ""We Are All Domestic Terrorists"" was also the title of a panel discussion, it should be noted. Present on that panel was Julie Pickren, a Texas State Board of Education candidate who claimed the title was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, the Houston Chronicle reported . ""Nobody in this room is a domestic terrorist,"" she reportedly told the crowd of attendees. Among other digital banners spotted during the conference was one bearing the slogan, ""You're Next: The Rise of the Democrat Gulag."" It's unclear if that one was tongue-in-cheek as well. A political science professor consulted by the Chronicle compared conservatives' sarcastic embrace of the descriptor ""domestic terrorists"" with their previous co-option of Hillary Clinton's characterization of Trump followers as a "" basket of deplorables .""

f798a61e-2dbd-416e-bdb8-48a1458a5953,"Fact Check Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s first wife, Ivana Trump, was laid to rest at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, based on media reports and photographs taken of the site. New York Post reporters visited the golf club and photographed Ivana Trump’s grave. Their report included a number of shots from different angles, including one revealing a wooded area near the site. A source told the New York Post that Ivana was buried not too far from the club house. According to the report, she was buried in a place that was not visible to golfers as they tee off for a round of golf. The small section of the club where she was buried is below the backside of the first tee. A number of memes consisting of edited versions of those photographs went viral in late July 2022, with one in particular getting tens of thousands of likes and comments on Instagram. The image — posted by Instagram account homegrownterrorists — showed a golf cart rolling past what appeared to be Ivana Trump's gravesite. It's clear that this photograph is fake when it's compared to the pictures published in the New York Post article . The gravesite has been inserted into a wider shot of a golf cart on a golf course fairway. Unlike the Post's photographs, the manipulated image doesn’t show a wooded area immediately adjacent to the grave. A separate rumor speculates that Trump used the burial site for tax break purposes. Indeed, the New Jersey tax code does exempt cemetery land from all taxes, rates, and assessments. Potentially, her grave could save the property from paying a significant sum in a state with high tax rates. According to the code , a cemetery company is exempt from paying real property taxes, income taxes, sales and use taxes, business taxes, and inheritance taxes; cemetery trust funds are also exempt from taxes. Trump has expressed his desire to be buried at the New Jersey golf course for years. His company even described it as his “favorite property” in a 2014 filing with the state. A 2017 Washington Post report revealed how he had been trying to convince local authorities to let him build cemeteries at the golf course since 2007. After numerous attempts, two of his plans were approved around 2017, but construction for them had not begun. The 2017 report said that the Trump Organization still needed to apply for state approval to make the land a public cemetery. However, Ivana Trump is the first known family member to be buried at the Bedminster golf club. Brooke Harrington , a sociology professor at Dartmouth and tax researcher, pointed out that the tax code has no stipulation for a minimum number of human remains needed for the tax breaks to apply. Documents published by ProPublica show that the Trump Family Trust had sought to designate a property in nearby Hackettstown, New Jersey, as a non-profit cemetery company. However, this was not the first time Trump had been accused of trying to reduce his taxes on the property by varying its use. A 2016 Wall Street Journal report found that the golf club benefited from a farmland tax break because part of the land was designated for agricultural purposes — specifically for hay production and a small herd of goats. The Huffington Post reported in 2019 that he had saved around $88,000 that year. New Jersey laws state “a landowner must have no less than five acres of farmland actively devoted to an agricultural or horticultural use for the two years immediately preceding the tax year being applied for and meet specific minimum gross income requirements based on the productivity of the land.” A representative for the Trump Organization told Fortune magazine that the links being drawn between Ivana Trump's gravesite and tax laws were “truly evil.” While it is unknown if the choice of this location for her grave had any connection to taxes, the Trump family has a history of seeking ways to reduce tax bills. Furthermore, given the photographs, and an acknowledgement from a Trump representative regarding the location of her grave while denying the rumors connecting it to tax laws, we rate the overall claim as “True.”",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,783

The post , which appeared to originate in May 2021 and was later copied and pasted by a large number of users, laid out what it claimed were a number of accomplishments in DeSantis' law and military careers. In our research, we found a variety of sources that confirmed that the key points made in the viral copypasta were accurate. The viral Facebook post about DeSantis ' life began with the following bit about an April 2021 segment on the CBS News program, ""60 Minutes"": Just in case you were wondering why 60 minutes had a hit piece on this Paisan - the Governor of Florida. Anyone who criticizes him - I have a question for you - can you please post your education and service to our country resume so we can put things in perspective? The controversy surrounding the episode of ""60 Minutes"" was addressed in an opinion piece published by Poynter. According to the article, the news magazine TV show failed to provide ""substantial evidence"" after claiming that DeSantis gave the Publix grocery store chain ""preferential treatment to distribute COVID-19 vaccines."" The charge was that DeSantis favored Publix simply because they donated to his campaign. He responded to the segment by calling it ""irresponsible"" and ""a lie."" According to the Poynter article, ""it doesn’t appear as if DeSantis did anything wrong."" The rest of the Facebook post recounted DeSantis' accomplishments before entering politics. It read as follows: Ronald Dion DeSantis was born on September 14, 1978, in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Karen (née Rogers) and Ronald DeSantis. He is of Italian descent. His family moved to Orlando, Florida, before relocating to Dunedin, Florida, when he was six years old. In 1991, he was a member of the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis attended Yale University. He was captain of Yale's varsity baseball team and joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On the Yale baseball team, DeSantis was an outfielder; as a senior in 2001, he had the team's best batting average at .336. He graduated from Yale in 2001 with a B.A. magna cum laude in history. He then spent a year as a history teacher at the Darlington School. DeSantis then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2005 with a Juris Doctor cum laude. DeSantis received his Reserve Naval officer's commission and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 at the U.S. Naval Reserve Center in Dallas, Texas, while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted from lieutenant, junior grade to lieutenant. He worked for the commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility. In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah. DeSantis returned to the U.S. in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service. The U.S. Department of Justice appointed him to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida. DeSantis was assigned as a trial defense counsel until his honorable discharge from active duty in February 2010. He concurrently accepted a reserve commission as a lieutenant in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the US Navy Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal. #DeSantis #leadership We weren't able to find documentation to verify the exact dates cited for all of these items.

c8c61f90-c979-427d-b67f-720120986275,"Fact Check The reporting below reflects facts as of July 2022. When Liz Truss resigned months later, on Oct. 20, we published a new story about Larry outlasting four, not three, British prime ministers. Being the first cat of the United Kingdom is not an easy job, especially when you have to deal with a revolving door of prime ministers. In July 2022, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader – and eventually as prime minister – after a series of scandals , and a collapse in support from his government ministers. While Johnson announced he would stay on until a replacement was selected, someone else will have a longer tenure than him: Larry the cat has been in residence at 10 Downing Street since Feb. 15, 2011, according to the British government’s official page , and was the first cat to hold the title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. He was adopted from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. According to the official government website , he has many roles: He has captured the hearts of the Great British public and the press teams often camped outside the front door. In turn the nation sends him gifts and treats daily. Larry spends his days greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defences and testing antique furniture for napping quality. His day-to-day responsibilities also include contemplating a solution to the mouse occupancy of the house. Larry says this is still ‘in tactical planning stage’. Larry has also outlasted three prime ministers, assuming he will still be present at 10 Downing Street after Johnson leaves his role. He arrived toward the early part of David Cameron’s tenure from 2010 to 2016, was a part of the household through Theresa May’s time from 2016 to 2019, and is expected to outlast Johnson’s tenure in the office. Cameron was believed to have a chilly relationship with Larry, and he posted a picture of the cat in his lap in an effort to dispel such rumors. May also hinted that she was more of a dog person. While a timetable for Johnson’s replacement had yet to be confirmed as of this writing, it took several weeks before he took over from his predecessor May. Larry himself has not commented on the upcoming changes. Meanwhile, Larry is expected to be waiting in 10 Downing Street and will likely be unimpressed with whoever is the new occupant.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,455
e8d19152-d2bc-41f2-9fae-4df9f3b61b77,"Fact Check In July 2022, critics of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson enjoyed a measure of schadenfreude when a series of scandals , and a collapse in support from his government ministers, prompted him to announce his resignation as Conservative party leader and — eventually — as prime minister. As part of that response, social media users enthusiastically shared photographs that appeared to show a Madame Tussauds wax figure of Johnson, relocated to stand outside an employment office in the north-western seaside town of Blackpool — with the joke being that he would soon find himself unemployed and, in theory, in need of assistance finding work. On July 7, for example, Twitter users posted pictures of the statue, along with captions that characterized the move as expert trolling on the part of Madame Tussauds: The photos were authentic and not the result of digital manipulation, and the descriptions accurately stated that Madame Tussauds in Blackpool had deliberately placed their figure of Johnson outside a nearby Jobcentre Plus, as a joke or publicity stunt. Our rating is ""True."" PA Media photographer Peter Byrne took the photographs on July 7, outside the Jobcentre Plus at 8 Albert Rd. in Blackpool — a two-minute drive from Madame Tussauds: On Twitter, Madame Tussauds in Blackpool acknowledged its stunt the following day: The Johnson figure was unveiled in Blackpool only a few months ago, with general manager Stuart Jarman saying at the time: Boris Johnson’s figure has proven to be an extremely popular attraction at our sister site in London, and we thought it only right that we ‘level up’ and have our very own wax work of the Prime Minister for our visitors to enjoy too. Madame Tussauds has a track record of using cheeky political symbolism to gain publicity for its attractions. In November 2020, for example, around the time of Joe Biden's U.S. presidential election win, the London museum re-dressed its figure of the outgoing White House resident Donald Trump in golfing attire , while the Berlin location rather more bluntly placed its Trump statute in a dumpster , along with a sign reading ""Dump Trump.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,393
69a74fd4-14bb-444f-8300-462ee4bf6541,"Fact Check In the summer of 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden faced allegations of hypocrisy and ""flip-flopping"" after he strongly condemned the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and remove federal constitutional protections for abortion access. Speaking on June 24, Biden described Roe as ""the correct decision as a matter of constitutional law, an application of the fundamental right to privacy and liberty in matters of family and personal autonomy,"" and he called the decision to overturn it a ""tragic error"" and the ""realization of an extreme ideology."" However, many observers — both to the left and right of Biden on the ideological spectrum — contrasted such remarks, in 2022, with what they presented as Biden's very different stance on the abortion rights landmark, four decades ago. U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., for example, wrote on Twitter : In 1982, Joe Biden proposed a constitutional amendment that would overturn Roe v. Wade and give the states the ability to regulate abortion. But today, he condemned the Dobbs decision. Unlike pro-life advocates, Biden has no backbone. He is ruled by the radical left. On June 24, one Facebook user published a viral post which contained a screenshot of an article by the London Independent , with the headline ""Biden voted to overturn Roe v Wade in 1982..."" and the caption ""Wonder how those protesting the Supreme Court decision feel about this. Chances are they are the same people that voted for Biden."" In recent years, the same core claim — that Biden once voted in favor of effectively overturning Roe and returning abortion policy to the states and the U.S. Congress — has featured in news articles by the The New York Times , Fox News , and the New York Post . That claim is accurate, although Biden did vote against an identical proposal just one year later. Our rating is ""True."" What Exactly Was the 1982 Vote About? The vote in question took place on March 10, 1982. Biden, then a U.S. senator for Delaware and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was considering a proposal put forward by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The proposal, Senate Joint Resolution 110 , contained the following text: Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, (two-thirds of each house concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress: ""ARTICLE — ""A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to restrict and prohibit abortion: Provided, That a provision of a law of a State which is more restrictive than a conflicting provision of a law of Congress shall govern."" The key finding of Roe was that the U.S. constitution — in particular the ""due process"" clause of the 14th amendment — recognized a right to privacy, and that that included a woman's right to an abortion. Hatch's proposed amendment would have explicitly inserted into the Constitution the assertion that ""a right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution."" Clearly, that would have been completely incompatible with Roe, and therefore would have effectively — and emphatically — overturned Roe. The amendment would also have returned to Congress and the states the ability to govern abortion access. This was precisely the effect of the Supreme Court's ruling, 40 years later, in Dobbs — the decision that ultimately overruled Roe. Hatch's proposal went even further, though, stipulating that, while Congress could enact legislation governing abortion access on a national level, if an individual state's abortion law was stricter than the federal law, the state law would take precedence. The amendment never made it as far as a vote in the full Senate or House, but on March 10, 1982, the Senate Judiciary Committee did vote to advance it out of committee for the consideration of the full Senate. As a later committee report described it , the committee voted 10-7 to ""favorably report out"" the proposal. This is an important distinction. Judiciary committee members can vote to advance a measure to the full Senate ""without recommendation,"" meaning that, whether or not they personally support the proposal, they believe it should be considered by the full Senate. Biden's March 1982 vote went further, and he joined the committee's majority in explicitly supporting the proposal itself. The votes were as follows: For : Hatch, R-Utah; Laxalt, R-Nev.; Dole, R-Kan.; Simpson, R-Wyo.; East, R-N.C.; Grassley, R-Iowa; Denton, R-Ala.; Biden, D-Del.; DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Thurmond, R-S.C. Against : Mathias, R-Md.; Specter, R-Penn.; Kennedy, D-Mass.; Byrd, D-W.Va.; Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Leahy, D-Vt.; Baucus, D-Mont. At the time, Biden said his vote was an exceptionally difficult one, and described abortion as ""the single most controversial issue in the United States of America.""  Snopes asked the White House for a fuller explanation of the reasoning behind Biden's March 1982 vote, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. Prior to that vote, the Delaware senator had expressed clear opposition to Roe. For example, in a 1974 interview he declared: ""I don’t like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don’t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body."" However, when Hatch submitted a similar proposed constitutional amendment in 1983, Biden voted against it, both in the judiciary committee and in the full Senate chamber . From that point, his public stance on abortion rights in general, and Roe in particular, evolved from one of hostility, to neutrality, and as of 2022, firm support.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1163

According to Google cache , a service implemented by the tech giant to archive websites, the tweet in the screenshot below was real: This Twitter discussion on the subject of abortion occurred one day following the news that the U.S. Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade , which essentially legalized abortion in the U.S. A user named @samthielman tweeted a picture to Walsh and asked, ""You truly believe THIS is a person?"" In response, Walsh or someone with control of his account chose to quote-tweet the question instead of inserting a traditional reply underneath, answering with, ""Yes."" The tweet then vanished from Walsh's account after @samthielman revealed that the image showed that of an elephant fetus. Before Walsh's tweet disappeared, it had already been liked thousands of times. According to two sources , the picture truly did show a fetus of an elephant. Before Walsh engaged with the elephant fetus image, another tweet on Walsh's account read, ""Could not be happier to see the pain and heartbreak of abortionists. Absolutely loving every minute of it."" This may have been what prompted the back-and-forth discussion with @samthielman. Charlie Kirk and the Dolphin Fetus Walsh's apparent elephant fetus mishap was similar to an incident in which conservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was asked about a different picture. In October 2021, actor and comedian Ben Gleib held up an image and asked Kirk, ""You truly, in your heart of hearts, truly believe that this is a human being?"" Kirk answered, ""Without a doubt."" Gleib then revealed to Kirk that the picture supposedly showed a dolphin fetus : Background In addition to The Matt Walsh Blog, Walsh also writes for the conservative website The Daily Wire and appeared in the 2022 documentary, ""What Is a Woman?""

427ec6ab-59e3-485e-bcc3-3be2583adbb6,"In June 2022, we were asked by readers to look at a Facebook post that was being copied and pasted. The viral post claimed that a woman pulled out a pistol while attending a party at an apartment complex in Charleston, West Virginia, shooting and killing a convicted felon named Dennis Butler after he began firing an AR-15 at the crowd. CNN, ABC News, NBC News, MSNBC, and ""other liberal news outlets"" did not report the news, the post claimed. While many of the major details in the post were indeed correct, it did contain several minor inaccuracies. Butler's apparent attempt to gun down partygoers in West Virginia came just one day after the mass shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. The Uvalde incident resulted in the deaths of 19 children and two adults . At least seventeen others were wounded , including both children and adults. The tragic shooting reignited the debate over enacting stricter gun control laws in the U.S. The Facebook Post At least two posts on Facebook that featured the copy-and-paste story received thousands of shares. One of those posts appeared on a Facebook page named WE R PRO 2 . This indicated that strong supporters of the Second Amendment were using the Charleston shooting in order to advance their opinions on the role of guns in American society. In the same way, those who support stricter gun control measures were using the Uvalde school shooting to advance their case. The copy-and-paste Facebook post that's in question in this fact check read as follows: On Friday, May 27, 2022, 4-time convicted felon Dennis Butler, opened fire on a graduation party in Charleston, West Virginia with a stolen AR-15. A woman (inset), pulled her legally owned and registered handgun from her purse and shot him dead before anyone was injured. I'm sorry I couldn't post this earlier, however, I couldn't find anything about it on CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, or any of the other Liberal news outlets. The Facts According to police, it's true that a woman, who was not identified, really did shoot and kill Butler after he began firing an AR-15-style rifle at a crowd that had gathered for a birthday-graduation party in West Virginia, according to reporting from The Associated Press. The shooting occurred on May 25 (not May 27 as was stated in the Facebook posts). Other than Butler's death, there were no other injuries. WRAL.com reported that Lt. Tony Hazelett with the Charleston Police Department said the woman prevented ""a mass casualty incident,"" stopping ""the threat of probably 20 or 30 people getting killed."" WRAL.com also published that the woman was ""carrying her firearm lawfully."" We didn't find any reporting to confirm that the woman specifically pulled the pistol from a purse, as was mentioned in the Facebook posts. However, this was a small and rather unimportant detail. As for Butler's criminal history, WCHSTV.com reported that he was a convicted felon, just as the posts claimed. We are still in the process of confirming with police whether he was in fact, a ""four-time"" convicted felon, as well as whether the AR-15-style rifle he used was indeed ""stolen."" CNN, ABC, NBC, and MSNBC The Facebook posts were also at least somewhat correct about the lack of reporting. We were unable to locate any evidence that CNN, NBC News, or MSNBC had reported the news, whether on their websites, in online videos, or on broadcasts for television. ABC News did, in fact, report on the shooting by republishing the story from The AP. As for NBC News, we found no published articles about the shooting or Butler's death on NBCNews.com or in transcripts from any of NBC's national broadcasts. At the same time, we did notice that the story from The AP was republished by NBCChicago.com , NBCNewYork.com , and other local news websites. The AP's story was also republished on CBSNews.com . In other words, the news about Butler, a man who fired an AR-15-style rifle into a crowd, who was shot and taken down by a woman with a pistol, was readily available on multiple well-known news websites. 'Children Were Playing' According to The AP, police said that Butler had been warned earlier in the evening by unidentified persons to slow his driving because ""children were playing"" nearby at the apartment complex . He later returned with the AR-15-style rifle and began firing: Dennis Butler, 37, was killed Wednesday night after he pulled out the rifle and began shooting at dozens of people attending the birthday-graduation party outside an apartment complex in the city of Charleston, police said in a statement. The woman, who was attending the party, drew a pistol and fired, killing Butler, the statement said. No one at the party was injured. “Instead of running from the threat, she engaged with the threat and saved several lives last night,” Chief of Detectives Tony Hazelett told news outlets Thursday. Butler was at the apartment complex earlier in the evening in a vehicle and had been warned to slow down because children were playing, police said. They said he left, but returned later, parked in front of the complex and began firing. The reporting said that no charges would be filed against the woman who killed Butler. In sum, the woman did, according to police, shoot and kill Butler with a pistol while he was firing an AR-15-style rifle into a crowd, very likely preventing a mass casualty incident. However, the popular copy-and-paste Facebook post that described the shooting included a few inaccuracies.

799b6612-64de-4fcb-b082-b0a9c8fd9aa5,"Fact Check An Indiana man won the Republican primary for local county elections in early May 2022, while in jail facing accusations of murdering his wife. Andrew Wilhoite, a local farmer , was running for one of the three open seats on the Clinton Township Board. He was charged in March 2022 with killing his cancer-stricken wife, Elizabeth “Nikki” Wilhoite. Wilhoite, however, withdrew from the ballot in mid-May 2022. He did not give a reason for the withdrawal. If he were to be convicted for a felony before the November general elections, his name would have been withdrawn from the ballots by election officials. He was incarcerated when police accused him of striking his wife in the head with a blunt object. Investigators said that he then “placed her into a vehicle and drove to a nearby creek where he dumped her body.” Prosecutors charged him with a level 1 murder felony. Wilhoite initially lied about his wife’s whereabouts, before admitting that he killed her after she attacked him, according to prosecutors. According to the local news Lebanon Reporter , Elizabeth had completed her last chemotherapy session and was seeking a divorce when she learned her husband had an affair with another woman. According to the affidavit, Wilhoite confessed that Elizabeth charged at him on the porch and he hit her with a “gallon-sized concrete flowerpot with dirt in it.” She fell to the ground and he did not know what to do, so he put her in his pickup truck. He described how he drove to a bridge over the creek and threw her over the wall and into the creek. The police were alerted after Elizabeth’s coworker asked them to check on her when she did not arrive for work saying that the couple had domestic troubles. Their three children had also been trying to get in touch with Elizabeth. According to election records , he received 60 votes for his seat, while the other Republican candidates received 100 and 106 votes respectively for the remaining seats. Wilhoite remained on the ballot as he faced murder charges in jail, and his jury trial was set to begin in August 2022.

We found this to be mostly true, with two clarifications. Our review of the application, which was provided to us by the Town of Edgartown's Selectboard , found that the request was for three propane tanks. When combined, the three tanks equalled 2,500 gallons. Also, the application indicated that the tanks would be installed above ground, not buried. The reason behind the tanks' purchase was not public at the time this article was published. The property's size was once mentioned by Chicago Sun-Times as measuring 29.3 acres . It's unclear if the tanks were meant for the Obamas, the U.S. Secret Service, or for another purpose. We reviewed earlier reporting about the application for the propane tanks from both Miami Standard and The Martha's Vineyard Times , also known as MVTimes.com. On June 7, 2022, The MV Times published the following: The select board approved a request for a 2,500-gallon commercial propane tank for 79 Turkeyland Cove Road in Katama — owned by former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. “We’ve never had a private propane tank come to us,” said select board member Arthur Smadbeck, with select board member Michael Donaroma noting a private-residence propane tank is typically a fraction of the quantity being requested. To confirm the reporting, we contacted the Town of Edgartown Selectboard in Massachusetts. The town is located on Martha's Vineyard . By phone, we requested the minutes from the Selectboard's meeting on June 6, as they weren't yet available on the board's website. We received the board's minutes by email. According to the two-page document, a single, 2,500-gallon propane tank was discussed by the board for a street address matching the Obamas' Martha's Vineyard property. The agenda item was introduced by the board's chairman, Margaret E. Serpa: Ms. Serpa then addressed the next item which was an application from Star Propane to install a buried 2500g tank at 79 Turkeyland Cove. Mr. Smadbeck moved to approve. Mr. Donaroma seconded. Unanimous. The minutes contained no additional information. We again inquired with the board by email, asking if the purpose of the propane was public knowledge or if they had any other information that could be passed along. In response, they sent the application for the tanks that had been signed on May 31, 2022. The application showed that a request had been made for three propane tanks, including two sized at 1,000 gallons and another one at 500 gallons. The name of the person who made the request was Ashley Tate-Gilmore. A person with the same name previously served as Obama's White House travel director. The news of the propane tanks led to a number of videos that pushed a conspiracy theory that the Obamas made the purchase for "" prepping ."" The conspiracy theory referred to the idea of preparing for a future and potentially apocalyptic turn of events, in particular a financial collapse. At the time, the Federal Reserve had sought to ""tame high inflation"" by putting forth its ""largest rate hike since 1994,"" according to The Associated Press . This led to fears of a possible future recession, the reporting said. In sum, an application was submitted to the Town of Edgartown for three propane tanks equalling a total of 2,500-gallon capacity that were to be installed above ground on the Obamas' property on Martha's Vineyard.

bc6d4623-5339-4de8-982e-fcf873e62ac4,"Fact Check In May 2022, social media users shared images that supposedly showed the face of the first U.S. President, George Washington, facing right — not left — on the front of a new quarter coin released in 2022. Many of these social media posts stated that Washington was now facing away from the coin's inscription ""In God We Trust ,"" and that the alleged change revealed a change in modern society's religious views. While we have no insight to offer on how this numismatic design does or does not reveal a change in the religious views of modern American society, we can say that Washington indeed previously faced left on the common quarter , and that the design for the coin released in 2022 has his profile facing right. There's no evidence to indicate that this design was chosen for any religious reasons. In fact, this isn't the first time that Washington has faced away from the words ""In God We Trust"" on a quarter. The U.S. Mint released the coin with Washington's profile facing right as part of its "" American Women Quarters Program ,"" an initiative that was set to run between 2022 and 2025 and include as many as five new quarters every year. For 2022, the U.S. Mint said it was releasing quarters to honor Maya Angelou , Dr. Sally Ride , Wilma Mankiller , Nina Otero-Warren , and Anna May Wong . As of this writing, the quarters featuring Ride and Angelou were currently in circulation. George Washington's profile appeared on the obverse side of each coin, no matter which woman it honored, and the design of it was new. Well, actually, it was an old design that had never been used. The design of a right-facing Washington was created by Laura Gardin Fraser , one of the 20th century's most prolific female sculptors, and submitted to the U.S. Mint in 1932 after Congress launched a design competition to honor Washington's 200th birthday. Fraser's design, which was based on a bust by French sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon and featured a right-facing Washington, didn't win the competition. Instead, Congress chose a design by John Flanagan , which featured the familiar sight of a left-facing Washington. Fraser's design While some social media users criticized the government for turning Washington ""away"" from the phrase ""In God We Trust,"" this isn't the first time that this has taken place. In 1999, for example, the U.S. Mint introduced its ""50 States"" series of quarters that featured a left-facing Washington and the words ""In God We Trust"" on the right side. Here's an image of the reverse side of a Pennsylvania quarter . In 2021, when the U.S. Mint announced designs for its initial run of quarters in the ""American Women Quarters Program "", then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen decided to use Fraser's 1932 design of Washington for the obverse side of the honorary coins. The U.S. Mint wrote in a news release : Contributions of American women have often been overlooked, but that is about to change. Literally. Beginning in 2022, the American Women Quarters™ Program will feature reverse designs honoring distinguished American women. One woman’s design, created 90 years ago, will take its place as the program’s common obverse: the unifying element of the program. [...] In 2022, 90 years after she intended for it to do so, Laura Gardin Fraser’s design will fittingly take its place on the quarter. It will be the obverse for the American Women Quarters Program, a four-year program that celebrates American women and the contributions they made to this country. The Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-330) requires a new obverse design that maintains a likeness of George Washington, but be designed so as to distinguish it from the one used during the previous quarters program. It should be noted that this was not the first time a piece of U.S. currency featured Fraser's work. Fraser was the first woman to design a commemorative coin, the 1921 Alabama Centennial Half Dollar , and her work can also be seen on the 1922 Grant Memorial Half Dollar and Gold Dollar , the 1925 Fort Vancouver Centennial Half Dollar , and the 1926 Oregon Trail Memorial Half Dollar . Also, the ""American Woman Quarters Program"" was not the first time that the U.S. Mint used Fraser's right-facing Washington design on a coin. The George Washington Commemorative Gold Five-Dollar coin, which was issued in 1999, featured it, too. Dean Kotlowski, a member of the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC), said of Fraser's design in a U.S. Mint news release : 'She’s able to create a sense of his seriousness of purpose. The cheek muscles, you see the strength, the strength of character. The looking ahead, straight ahead, the sense of vision. All of these come together with a sense of statesmanship and a commanding presence that she is able to achieve with remarkable ease.' In sum, it was true that quarters released in 2022 showed Washington facing right, while the common quarter had depicted his profile looking left. However, there wasn't any evidence that the design of the new quarters had anything to do with religion. Fraser's right-facing design was chosen, in part, because the series of coins honored the contributions of women to American society and Fraser was a well-known female sculptor. Furthermore, the isn't the first time that Washington has faced away from the phrase ""In God We Trust.""

Let that sink in."" We found that this was a true statement, as it was announced that the U.S. Secret Service was set to take over control of the room for the NRA event when former U.S. President Donald Trump was scheduled to speak. The convention, formally known as the National Rifle Association Annual Meeting (NRA AM), was set to begin on May 27 inside the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston, Texas . The tweet was posted in the aftermath of the deadly shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde , which is also located in Texas. On May 24, three days before the convention was set to begin, a gunman took the lives of at least 19 children and two adults before he also was killed by a Border Patrol agent who responded to the scene. A report from NPR.org linked to the NRA convention website , which confirmed that guns would be banned during the event that included Trump's speech. It showed that the former president's address would be happening on on May 27, sometime between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. in the Central time zone: Join NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, NRA-ILA Executive Director Jason Ouimet, and our nation's top Second Amendment supporters for the 2022 NRA-ILA Leadership Forum on Friday, May 27th. IMPORTANT: Security Information for the NRA-ILA Leadership Forum. Please read carefully. … With the announcement that President Donald J. Trump will be speaking at the Forum, the U.S. Secret Service will take control of the General Assembly Hall and have magnetometers in place before entry. You will be subject to a search of your person and belongings. Per the U.S. SECRET SERVICE, firearms, firearm accessories, knives, and other items WILL NOT BE PERMITTED in the General Assembly Hall. For a full list of prohibited items, please click here . Read the list of prohibited items carefully before traveling to the event. You will not be allowed in the General Assembly Hall with any of the items on this list. There is no storage available for firearms. According to a separate flyer linked to on the page, a number of items in addition to guns were banned by the U.S. Secret Service, specifically during the event that included Trump's NRA speech: Source: NRAAM.org The list showed the following products: aerosols, ammunition, backpacks, bags larger than 18""x13""x7"", drones and other unmanned aircraft systems, firearms, glass/thermal/metal containers, gun parts, holsters, knives, laser pointers, mace/pepper spray, magazines, selfie sticks, signs, toy guns, umbrellas, weapons of any kind, and any other item determined to be potential safety hazards.

bec6df7f-74de-40fa-963b-4f9c76b23b2e,"Fact Check On May 24, 2022, a gunman entered Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and killed 19 children and two teachers . It was the 212th mass shooting in the U.S. (defined by the Gun Violence Archive as a shooting in which four or more people were shot or killed, excluding the shooter) of 2022, and the 27th shooting to take place in a school . As news circulated that 19 children under the age of 10 had been killed in another mass shooting, Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors basketball team, expressed outrage at the lawmakers who refuse to vote on the federal bill H.R. 8, the ""Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021,"" and noted that 90% of Americans support universal background checks for gun purchases. Kerr said :  ""Do you realize that 90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want background checks, universal background checks? 90% of us ... We are being held hostage by 50 Senators in Washington who refuse to even put it to a vote, despite what we the American people want. They won't vote on it because they want to hold on to their own power."" Do 90% of Americans Want Universal Background Checks? A number of polls taken over the years show that the vast majority of Americans support universal background checks for those wanting to buy guns. In 2015, for example, a national Public Policy Polling survey of gun owners found overwhelming support (83%) for background checks, a 2018 Gallup poll found that 95% of people supported ""requiring background checks for all gun sales,"" and in 2019, a Quinnipiac University poll from 2019 found that 94% of American voters supported universal background checks. The Pew Research Center wrote in 2019 : When it comes to specific gun-related policies, the public finds broad agreement in certain areas. Overwhelming majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (91%) and Republicans and Republican-leaners (92%) say they strongly or somewhat favor barring people with mental illnesses from purchasing guns. These views are largely unchanged since the question was first asked in 2017. Similarly, large majorities in both parties continue to favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks (93% of Democrats, 82% of Republicans). Kerr's claim that 90% of Americans support universal background checks falls within the scope of the available data. What is H.R. 8? H.R. 8 is a bill that would expand background checks for all firearm sales in the country (including sales by private and non-licensed sellers). This bill establishes new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties (i.e., unlicensed individuals). Specifically, it prohibits a firearm transfer between private parties unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. The prohibition does not apply to certain firearm transfers or exchanges, such as a gift between spouses in good faith. While the legislation has already passed in the U.S. House, the bill has been held up in the Senate where it needs 60 votes to pass. CNN reported : Another bill, HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, would expand background checks for all firearm sales or transfers in the country. Currently, background checks are not required for gun sales and transfers by unlicensed and private sellers. The legislation has bipartisan support, passing the House last year in a 227-203 vote. Eight Republicans supported the bill and one Democrat voted against it. [...] For now, either Democrats must all agree to end the filibuster or Republicans must begin to support gun control measures in larger numbers. Until then, there will be no new federal gun laws.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,714

In one viral tweet , politics lecturer Yuan Yi Zhu captioned the picture ""Margaret Thatcher telling off a young Justin Trudeau, c. 1984"": The photograph is entirely authentic, not the result of digital manipulation, and does indeed show Thatcher and Trudeau, next to his father, then-Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Thus, we are issuing a rating of ""True."" However, contemporary accounts suggest Thatcher was having a friendly conversation with the young Trudeau, rather than chastising him, and the date provided in the May 2022 tweet, specifically, was off by a few years. The picture was taken on June 25, 1980 (not 1984 or thereabouts), and shows Thatcher talking to Trudeau outside 10 Downing Street — the official residence of the U.K. prime minister — in London. Behind Trudeau is his father, and to Thatcher's left, wearing an orange coat, is Jean Casselman Wadds, then Canadian high commissioner to the U.K. The Canadian government actually holds two slightly different versions of the shot — one showing Thatcher with her eyes open , as in the May 2022 post, and the other with her eyes closed . Several other photographs showed the same scene, with Thatcher wearing a distinctive bow at her collar, the elder Trudeau wearing the same jacket, and the young Trudeau wearing the same wind-breaker: Trudeau, then 8 years old, had accompanied his father on a trip to Europe , during which the Canadian PM attended talks and summits in Italy, the U.K.,  and Norway. While in Rome, both generations of Trudeaus obtained an audience with Pope John Paul II. Several contemporary news reports described Justin as having been sitting in a car at 10 Downing Street, but beckoned out on to the street by Thatcher, who was keen to chat to him. A brief, friendly exchange then took place, according to reports. For example, the Vancouver Sun wrote that : [Thatcher] spotted Justin huddled in the back of the Daimler, reported the Daily Mail. The newspaper said Justin explained that he was off to the zoo to see some baby monkeys. ""Have you seen them?"" he asked Thatcher. ""No,"" she said. ""But you must tell me about them when we meet again."" In their 1990 political biography of Pierre Trudeau , Stephen Clarkson and Christina McCall cited a report by the Toronto Sun, and wrote of the June 25, 1980, meeting: The amiable nature of the occasion was pointed up by an exchange between Margaret Thatcher and Justin Trudeau, who had come with his father to Europe and was waiting for him in a limousine so they could go first to the London zoo and then to Buckingham Palace. The Iron Lady and the eight-year-old were photographed shaking hands amidst much prime ministerial joshing, with Trudeau trying to intervene to prevent the photo session from continuing. When the Canadians finally drove away, Justin grinned, stuck out his tongue, and waved from the limousine's back-seat.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,605

6f29cc98-59ac-492f-a24c-a110e42c5088,"Fact Check The Florida Department of Education rejected a number of mathematics textbooks for public schools that the department said contained references to critical race theory (CRT), and other “prohibited topics or unsolicited strategies.” On April 19, 2022 , Gov. Ron DeSantis said the material in the rejected textbooks was “proprietary” and as such would not be made public. In a statement on its website, the Department of Education said 41% of the submitted textbooks on the list would not be included for the following reasons (emphasis added): The approved list followed a thorough review of submissions at the Department, which found 41 percent of the submitted textbooks were impermissible with either Florida’s new standards or contained prohibited topics – the most in Florida’s history. Reasons for rejecting textbooks included references to Critical Race Theory (CRT), inclusions of Common Core, and the unsolicited addition of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) in mathematics. The highest number of books rejected were for grade levels K-5, where an alarming 71 percent were not appropriately aligned with Florida standards or included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies. Despite rejecting 41 percent of materials submitted, every core mathematics course and grade is covered with at least one textbook. The department did not share information on the specific content that it objected to and the textbook publishers told The New York Times they had not received details about the objections. “It seems that some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,” DeSantis said. In 2021, Florida banned CRT from all classrooms in the state, arguing that instruction “must be factual and objective, and may not suppress or distort significant historical events.” Back then DeSantis took issue with the curriculum, describing it as “the theory that racism is not merely the product of prejudice, but that racism is embedded in American society and its legal systems in order to uphold the supremacy of white persons."" Snopes has covered CRT and the controversies surrounding it previously. In recent years, Florida has passed legislation limiting the ways that race, gender, sexual orientation and social-emotional wellness can be taught and discussed in classrooms. DeSantis is also expected to sign legislation that prohibits instruction that could potentially make students feel uncomfortable about historical events because of their own race, sex, or origins. The Department of Education also cited materials from the Common Core as objectionable. Common Core is a nationwide effort to standardize mathematics and literacy curriculum expectations, and Florida and a number of other states have pushed back against it. While the exact content described as objectionable is not publicly available, this did not stop many on the internet from sharing posts falsely purporting to show pages from the rejected mathematics textbooks. One post on Facebook claimed that a question in a math textbook that also mentioned sexual abuse was in one of the rejected books. In reality , the question was from a math textbook in a Philadelphia high school (a claim we fact-checked back in 2018). Some of the questions related to the life of the Black poet Maya Angelou, as outlined in her autobiography , ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings .

The people listed (from left to right) were Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke , former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain , conservative commentator Ben Shapiro , and former U.S. Housing Secretary Ben Carson . The tweet was authored by Jason Campbell of Media Matters for America , a left-leaning media researching group, shortly after 7 a.m. Over the course of hours, it had received almost 29,000 ""likes"" and 3,800 retweets (and counting), with many observers noting that Shapiro is white and Cain died in July 2020 after battling COVID-19. The tweet depicted an authentic visual moment from the conservative news outlet, though omitted the fact that concurrent audio (the host speaking) made clear that Cain was dead and Shapiro was white. Considering those facts, which we outline in detail below, we rate this claim ""True."" First, we went to Newsmax's website, where it archives recent video segments. We found the clip in question: a segment that aired the day prior on host Greg Kelly 's show, titled ""Greg Kelly Reports."" Around the 13-minute mark, the program showed footage of former President Donald Trump at a South Carolina rally, where he criticized an unspecified group of news outlets for ""not getting it"" — supposedly in reference to racial inequality in the U.S. Then, Kelly said: ""You can watch hours upon hours, centuries, actually, of the fake news ... and not learn a damn thing about what's really happening in terms of race in America, in my opinion. They're having a silly, foolish conversation about race to avoid having a serious, impactful one to actually help people."" Instead of turning to mainstream news outlets for updates on the era's ongoing civil rights movement , Kelly advised viewers to listen to actor Chris Rock and showed a years-old skit by the comedian titled, ""How Not to Get Your Ass Kicked by the Police."" Then, the Newsmax host called attention to the death of Patrick Lyola , a 26-year-old Black man who was fatally shot by a white officer in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and shared what he supposedly considers to be advice to avoid poverty and/or incarceration. As he spoke those words, the screen displayed the messages: ""A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE"" and ""LYOLA WOULD BE ALIVE IF LISTENED TO CHRIS ROCK"" and ""GO TO SCHOOL, GET MARRIED & HAVE KIDS."" Soon after that, the screen showed clips of Democratic politicians — which included U.S. President Joe Biden and U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley — talking about systemic racism and its existence throughout U.S. history. Among them was Yasmin Vossoughian , an MSNBC anchor. After that, the screen indeed depicted the headshots and names of Clarke, Cain, Shapiro, and Carson, all above a chyron that read: ""LEFT CONSIDERS BLACK CONSERVATIVES TO BE TRAITORS."" Meanwhile, Kelly said verbatim, according to the video: I wonder what Yasmin would do, and any of those other people, when they meet a Black conservative. They're out there, but they're shunned because, boy oh boy, what they have to say. And the late Herman Cain and, of course Ben Shapiro — not Black but one of the heroes of the movement. This really disrupts the narrative, and that's why they are marginalized, and they shouldn't be. They should be celebrated and listened to. In sum, it was true that Newsmax aired the headshots, and listed the names of Clarke, Cain, Shapiro, and Carson above the in-question chyron.

Social media users, primarily those ideologically opposed to Carlson, mocked the clip, describing it as homoerotic , while others questioned whether it was authentic or a parody. The clip was entirely authentic, but it was taken from a longer trailer published by Tucker on April 15, to promote the second season of his Fox News feature series ""Tucker Carlson Presents."" It did give a slightly reductive and over-simplified impression of the trailer, which was more than twice as long, and contained more context than was shown in the clip.

One Twitter user, for example, posted the below-displayed meme about the 39th president in April 2022: A reverse-image search of the meme revealed numerous instances in which internet users promoted this underlying claim: that Carter, at age 95, fell, received stitches and then the following day helped build houses for Habitat for Humanity — a Christian nonprofit that helps low-income families build homes and pay their mortgages. [See also: Why Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters? ] The claim was true — though the incident had occurred more than two years ago, as of this writing. On Oct. 7, 2019, The Associated Press published the photographs featured in the meme, writing : NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — With a bandage above his left eye and a large, red welt below it, former President Jimmy Carter was greeted by a cheering crowd Monday morning as he prepared to help build a home with Habitat for Humanity in Nashville. Carter fell at home on Sunday, requiring 14 stiches, but he did not let his injuries keep him from participating in his 36th building project with the nonprofit Christian housing organization. He turned 95 last Tuesday, becoming the first U.S. president to reach that milestone. The newspaper reported that he and his wife, former First Lady Rosalyn Carter, worked that day on building corbels, a type of support bracket, for a home. CNN also reported on the public appearance, including the following quote from the former president in its Oct. 8, 2019, story: “I fell down and hit my forehead on a sharp edge and had to go to the hospital. And they took 14 stitches in my forehead and my eye is black, as you’ve noticed,” he said. “But I had a No. 1 priority and that was to come to Nashville and build houses.” According to the nonprofit's website , the couple formed a partnership with Habitat for Humanity in the 1980s , and they have rallied ""thousands of volunteers and even celebrities"" to join the organization's cause since then. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, Habitat for Humanity paused its so-called ""Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project,"" a reoccurring event during which the couple fundraises to build a grouping of homes somewhere.

2aac5d13-6b0d-4c94-b879-52d3deb8cf76,"In March 2022, MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell outlined some interesting historical context for the grilling of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson by Republicans during Senate confirmation hearings. O'Donnell claimed that the tradition of public confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees was not in place for the dozens of white Christian men who assumed a seat on the court after its establishment in 1789, but was urgently created for the first Jewish nominee Louis Brandeis in 1916. O'Donnell's presentation of the facts was highly accurate. His argument — that the tradition of rigorous and hostile senate confirmation hearings was started in response to the nomination of the first Jewish justice — was largely correct. However, he did omit to mention a closed-door hearing for one nominee in 1873, and he mistakenly claimed the Senate ""stopped asking questions for decades"" after Brandeis, when in fact, just nine years later, another nominee was grilled for several hours by Senate committee members. We are therefore issuing a rating of ""Mostly True."" What Lawrence O'Donnell Said O'Donnell made the claim on Twitter on March 22, where he wrote : ""For the 1st 127 years when only white Christian men were allowed to be Supreme Court Justices, there were zero confirmation hearings. Confirmation hearing was invented for the 1st Jewish nominee."" Earlier, he devoted a segment on his MSNBC show ""The Last Word"" to dissecting the demographic and historical background of the nomination of Jackson who, if she is confirmed, would become the first Black woman to sit on the nation's highest court. O'Donnell explained: Most of the 115 Supreme Court justices did not even graduate from law school. Only 49 of them were actually law school graduates. For the first 127 years, the Supreme Court was a bastion of affirmative action for white Christian men only ... And not one of them ever had to answer a single question from a senator about anything. Not one of them had confirmation hearings. Not one . At least one of those people was confirmed by the full senate the day after he was nominated. That's how easy it was. Then, in 1916, came the first Jewish nominee for the United States Supreme Court — Harvard Law School graduate Louis Brandeis. And that is when the confirmation hearing had to be invented . The white Christian men of the senate wanted to ask some questions of the first Jewish nominee to the Supreme Court. After Justice Brandeis was confirmed, the senate stopped asking questions for decades. They had no questions for Stanley Reed, in 1938 — the last Supreme Court justice who did not graduate from law school. Only in the television age did confirmation hearings become routine for Supreme Court justices, and that was entirely because senators wanted to be on TV. [Emphasis is added]. Early History of Senate Confirmation Hearings According to research conducted by the Congressional Research Service — a non-partisan and highly reliable source — there were 101 nominations of Supreme Court associate or chief justices between 1789 and 1916. Of those, none was subjected to public hearings of any Senate committee, thus effectively supporting the first part of O'Donnell's claim. In January 1916, that changed dramatically. After the death of Justice Joseph Lamar, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis, a progressive lawyer born in Kentucky but based in Massachusetts, and known for suing major corporations, defending workers' rights, and advocating privacy protections. Many Republicans fiercely opposed Brandeis's nomination, in part because they portrayed him as a "" radical"" and a ""socialist ,"" but also, undoubtedly, because Brandeis was Jewish . Senators would subject Brandeis to an unprecedented 19 days of committee hearings (although he himself did not attend in person ), and it would take four months for his appointment to be confirmed — still a record for the slowest successful Supreme Court confirmation process in history. In the end, the Senate confirmed his appointment by 47 votes to 22 in June 1916, and Brandeis served on the court until 1939, becoming one of the major legal figures in the United States in the 20th century. While Brandeis was the first Supreme Court nominee subjected to public hearings — contentious, protracted hearings at that — the Senate had held closed-door hearings on one occasion in the previous 127 years. In December 1873, President Ulysses S. Grant nominated Attorney General George Henry Williams to serve as Supreme Court Chief Justice. Initially, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended his nomination be confirmed, but later that month, reversed course after the emergence of several rather murky allegations of corruption and embezzlement against Williams. After holding two ""executive"" (that is, private) sessions, the committee members unanimously opposed Williams' ascension, and in January 1874, Williams himself asked Grant to withdraw his name from consideration, which Grant duly did. After Brandeis, the Senate largely resumed its previous practice of confirming or rejecting Supreme Court nominations without the need for substantial public hearings. However, there were closed hearings in 1922, and in 1925, the Senate judiciary committee held a public hearing on the nomination of Attorney General Harlan Stone. There, committee members grilled Stone for several hours , in what was the first ever occasion on which a Supreme Court nominee appeared in person to answer questions submitted by the senate. That spectacle took place less than nine years after the Brandeis hearings. So O'Donnell's claim that after Brandeis, ""the senate stopped asking questions for decades"" is not right. Senate hearings were very rare, and the intensity of scrutiny to which Brandeis was subjected was indeed unique at that time. However, he was not the only Supreme Court nominee made to sweat over his confirmation during that era. The next public hearing came in 1930, and during that decade Supreme Court nominees were as likely as not to face public hearings in the judiciary committee. From the 1940s onward, though, Supreme Court nominees were more likely than not to be subjected to committee hearings.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1119

As of the original publication of this article on March 22, 2022, Nestle was still operating in Russia following that nation’s invasion of Ukraine. In a statement dated March 11, the company said that it was “shocked and deeply saddened by the invasion of Ukraine” and noted that in addition to certain limitations on its production activity in Russia, Nestle was continuing to keep its activities “under close review.” “As a food company and employer, we recognize that we also have a responsibility toward our more than 7,000 employees in Russia — most of whom are locals. We will continue to do our utmost to ensure a reliable supply of safe and essential food products for the local people,” read the statement, which is archived here . Nestlé further noted that it was continuing to “focus on meeting the needs of the local people” by doing the following: We have halted all our advertising activities in Russia We have suspended all capital investment in the country We have suspended exports of our products out of Russia (except for essential foods, like baby food, to Commonwealth of Independent States countries) We have suspended imports of our products into Russia (one example being Nespresso) except for essential foods (including baby food, cereals, and tailored nutrition and therapeutic pet foods for specialist retailers and veterinarian clinics) The decision to keep operating in Russia came under fire after international governments and a number of private organizations announced their own forms of sanctions against President Vladimir Putin . As the Swiss company announced its decision to remain, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy singled Nestle out during a livestreamed speech, reported Bloomberg News and CNN . ""'Good food. Good life.' This is the slogan of Nestle. Your company that refuses to leave Russia. Even now — when there are threats from Russia to other European countries. Not only to us. When there is even nuclear blackmail from Russia,"" the president reportedly said. Nestle continued to sell things like baby food, cereal, and pet food in Russia, according to a CBS News report . Similarly, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal made pointed remarks on social media to Nestle CEO Mark Shneider about the “side effect of staying in the Russian market.” “Unfortunately, he shows no understanding. Paying taxes to the budget of a terrorist country means killing defenseless children&mothers [sic]. Hope that Nestle will change its mind soon,” Shmyhal tweeted on March 17 . A spokesperson for the food company reportedly responded to the allegations in an email to CBS MoneyWatch . ""The fact that we, like other food companies, supply the population with important food does not mean that we simply continue as before,"" the spokesperson reportedly said. ""We are doing whatever we can in Ukraine and neighboring countries to help alleviate this humanitarian catastrophe. We are still one of the few active food companies in Ukraine and sometimes even manage to distribute food in Kharkiv,"" added the spokesperson.

d60796f9-942e-4ff2-8f19-fd1953f9cc2d,"The U.S. and European countries began isolating Russia economically since its invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. At the same time, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration came under fire from right-wing media for its reported dependence on Russian oil. Fox News host Sean Hannity claimed on his show, “This oil is Putin's lifeblood, and it is and has always been. And to me, it's just incomprehensible and frankly unconscionable that despite these terrifying war crimes that you see unfolding every day and night against men, women and children, that the Biden administration continues to buy this thug's oil.” He said that Russia was selling billions of dollars worth of oil to the U.S. and European countries, and was effectively enabling Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. The U.S. does import oil and other energy products from Russia. However, in March 2022, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the U.S. government was “exploring” options to ban all imports of Russian oil and energy products. ""Our bill would ban the import of Russian oil and energy products into the United States, repeal normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus, and take the first step to deny Russia access to the World Trade Organization,” she said. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki discussed the possibility on Feb. 25, 2022, saying “on the energy sector, no option is off the table.” Psaki added that cutting imports could have harmful effects in the U.S.: But again, to go back to [...] some of the principles here, our sanctions are designed to harm Russia’s economy, not our economy, and that’s a key balance that we’re clearly trying to strike. [...] The other factor here on the energy sector is that starting out with energy or — could actually benefit President Putin and pad his pockets because, given high oil and gas prices, cutting off Russian oil and gas could drive prices up to Putin’s benefit. How Much Energy Does US Import from Russia? According to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2020 total Russian petroleum (including crude oil) made up only 7% of imports. The U.S. imported 52% of its total petroleum from Canada, by comparison. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) trade association said that in 2021 the U.S. imported 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 500,000 bpd of other petroleum products from Russia. “Although Russian crude accounts for only three percent of U.S. crude oil imports and about one percent of total crude oil processed by U.S. refineries—Russian crude oil imports are important to refineries on the West Coast and Gulf Coast,” the group said , referring to 2021 numbers. By comparison , 61 percent of imports came from Canada, 10 percent from Mexico, and 6 percent from Saudi Arabia. Russian imports of crude oil to the U.S. have increased since 2019, “to help replace heavy sour crude from Venezuela that U.S. refineries can no longer import.” According to Adam Pankratz , a professor at the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business, one potential scenario of cutting out Russian oil would result in the U.S. relying on its strategic petroleum reserves, and so the country would not be badly affected by the loss in oil supply. On the other hand, Pankratz told Al Jazeera , “If the U.S. stopped importing Russian oil, that would mean that likely many other countries would also no longer be importing Russian oil, and that would make a very tight oil market already much tighter, and that would drive up the price of oil and that in turn can drive inflation, which in turn can affect the US economy.” AFPM suggested policies that could blunt the impact of reducing Russian energy supplies: While there is no near-term, silver-bullet policy to blunt the impact of geopolitical disruptions of the market, pursuing policies that allow domestic production to return to pre-pandemic levels will help to provide market stability and insulate not only the U.S. but the world from major disruptions. Policymakers can also provide relief from policies that increase the cost of producing refined product and policies that make it uneconomic to transport crude oil and petroleum products domestically. Nearly half of Russia’s overall exports are of crude oil, petroleum, and natural gas. According to Russia’s finance ministry , the country made around $119 billion in oil and gas revenue in 2021. In October 2021, the country made almost $500 million per day from oil and gas sales. The E.U., U.K. and U.S. together accounted for about half of Russia’s goods exports in 2021, which means they are effectively providing a significant chunk of Russia’s revenue from energy exports. The U.S. is still importing Russian energy products. However, the U.S. is not as reliant on them as a source of energy as expected, and is considering legislation that bans imports from Russia.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s lack of military service has been frequently commented on by conservatives, even before he became president. Snopes readers also sent us numerous requests to look into Biden’s history of draft deferments, asking for confirmation of the circumstances under which he was able to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. Some asked us specifically if it was true that he received five draft deferments because of his asthma as a teenager. Biden’s Selective Service records were released in 2008 to The Associated Press by the campaign of then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. According to the documents, Biden did receive a total of five draft deferments when he was an undergraduate at the University of Delaware and when he was a law student at Syracuse University. However, all of these deferments were granted by reason of his status as a student, not because of any medical condition. According to the draft classifications , one can receive a deferment as a student. Classification 1-S denotes, “Student deferred by status – (H) high school; (C) college.” Before Congress reformed the draft in 1971, ""a man could qualify for a student deferment if he could show he was a full-time student making satisfactory progress in virtually any field of study."" Under current law , college students can have their induction postponed ""only until the end of the current semester,"" while seniors can postpone it until the end of the full academic year. David Wade, then an Obama campaign spokesperson, told The Associated Press, “As a result of a physical exam on April 5, 1968, Joe Biden was classified 1-Y and disqualified from service because of asthma as a teenager.” I-Y means “Registrant qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency.” This classification was abolished in December 1971. Less detailed records of Biden’s Selective Service draft card are available on the National Archives website. The Associated Press noted that in Biden’s memoir, “Promises to Keep,” he did not mention his asthma, and described an active childhood as a lifeguard and football player. Biden is not the only leader who took advantage of student deferments. Former Vice President Dick Cheney also received five draft deferments . His first four were because he was a student, and the fifth because he became a father. While Biden did indeed receive five draft deferments, these were due to his status as a student. Later, when he underwent a physical exam, he was classified unable to serve owing to his history of asthma. As such, we rate this claim as “Mostly True.”",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,541
809ee3be-00b8-451a-8fba-a78dd3e83aa9,"In late 2021, we received multiple inquiries from Snopes readers seeking to verify the authenticity of a fascinating story, told in several widely shared social media posts, about one of the pre-White House accomplishments of former President Jimmy Carter. For example, on Dec. 14 Jeff Lundeen posted a very widely shared tweet that contained an old picture of a young Carter, a screenshot of the anecdote, and the following caption: Do you remember the world's very first nuclear meltdown? That time the US President, an expert in nuclear physics, heroically lowered himself into the reactor and saved Ottawa, Canada's capital? Sounds like schlocky action movie, but it actually happened! That tweet was itself drawn from an earlier Facebook post by the Historical Society of Ottawa, which can be seen below: The core claim from those accounts was that, as a young naval officer, Carter played a significant role in containing a nuclear meltdown. That claim was accurate, and we are issuing a rating of ""True."" In main control room of USS K-1 (SSK-1) between June and October 1952. (Source: Naval History and Heritage Command). Carter, who was born in 1924 and grew up in Plains, Georgia, had a relatively short but distinguished naval career, as summarized by the U.S. Navy itself : President James Earl ""Jimmy"" Carter graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 with distinction, after which he was assigned to USS Wyoming (E-AG 17) as an ensign. After completing two years of surface ship duty, Carter applied for submarine duty. He served as executive officer, engineering officer, and electronics repair officer on the submarine SSK-1 . When Admiral Hyman G. Rickover (then a captain) started his program to create nuclear-powered submarines, Carter wanted to join the program and was interviewed and selected by Rickover. Carter was promoted to lieutenant and from 3 November 1952 to 1 March 1953, he served on temporary duty with the Naval Reactors Branch, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C., to assist ""in the design and development of nuclear propulsion plants for naval vessels."" From 1 March to 8 October 1953, Carter was preparing to become the engineering officer for USS Seawolf (SSN-575), one of the first submarines to operate on atomic power. However, when his father died in July 1953 Carter resigned from the Navy and returned to Georgia to manage his family interests. Carter was honorably discharged on 9 October 1953 and transferred to the retired reserve at his request with the rank of lieutenant. On Dec. 12, 1952, an accident took place at the National Research Experimental (NRX) nuclear reactor at Chalk River, near the Canadian capital of Ottawa. A detailed, official Atomic Energy of Canada account of the incident and its aftermath can be found here and here . Having been promoted to lieutenant in June of that year, Carter was at that time on secondment from the Navy to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Division of Reactor Development at Schenectady, in upstate New York. A 2019 video, vetted and published by All Hands, the official magazine of the U.S. Navy, contained the following account of the future president's involvement in the cleanup operation: Due to a combination of mechanical failure and human error, a power surge of up to 90 megawatts caused some fuel rods to melt after rupturing in the NRX research reactor at Chalk River Laboratories. The reactor's core was baldy damaged, requiring a massive cleanup operation. This was the first incident of this magnitude, and Carter was ordered to lead a team of 23 people to assist in the cleanup. When he arrived on the scene, there was a duplicate reactor set up on a nearby tennis court, where he and his team would practice removing bolts and pieces as quickly as they could. Once lowered into the damage reactor, each person would only have 90 seconds to work, due to the extreme radioactivity. The core was shut down, rebuilt, and put back into operation without further incident. Reflecting on the episode in 2008, Carter told the Canadian author Arthur Milnes that he and his team were exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation at Chalk River, as Milnes would later write for CNN : ""We were fairly well instructed then on what nuclear power was, but for about six months after that I had radioactivity in my urine,"" President Carter, now 86, told me during an interview for my new book in Plains in 2008. ""They let us get probably a thousand times more radiation than they would now. It was in the early stages and they didn't know."" Despite the fears he had to overcome, Carter admits he was animated at the opportunity to put his top-secret training to use in the cleanup of the reactor, located along the Ottawa River northwest of Ottawa. ""It was a very exciting time for me when the Chalk River plant melted down,"" he continued in the same interview. ""I was one of the few people in the world who had clearance to go into a nuclear power plant,"" he said. ""There were 23 of us and I was in charge. I took my crew up there on the train.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,990

(Courtesy: Bettmann / Contributor) In 2019, Kennedy's bloody shirt made the news after a hoax went around that claimed reality TV show star Kim Kardashian had gifted the item to one of her children, North. This was not true. At the time, People.com reported : Kim Kardashian West is setting the record straight on whether or not she gifted her 6-year-old daughter North former President John F. Kennedy‘s bloody button-down shirt for Christmas. On Monday, a fan on Twitter called out Refinery29 after the media outlet published a report , which included a photo originally believed to be from the reality star’s Instagram Stories depicting the shirt, which JFK assumably wore on the day he was assassinated in 1963. “I AM SCREAMING someone tweeted as a joke that Kim Kardashian gifted North JFK’s bloody shirt and Refinery29 wrote about it as if it were true????” the fan wrote on Twitter alongside a grab of the article, highlighting the excerpt “What is North West going to do with JFK’s bloody shirt? And why isn’t it in a museum?” Kardashian tweeted that the rumor was ""fake"" and a ""sick joke."" Also related to Kennedy's assassination, we found reporting from 2013 where the Houston Chronicle and The Associated Press chronicled another bloody shirt. This one belonged to Texas Gov.

7783daa6-d32e-4060-9435-8b1930db782c,"In November 2021, a jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin, acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse on all charges related to his involvement in fatal shootings during civil unrest linked to protests against racial injustice and police brutality in August 2020. In the aftermath of the verdicts, Rittenhouse and his many supporters expressed resentment at what they presented as unfair and prejudicial commentary on the shootings. In particular, several observers highlighted remarks made by President Joe Biden and his campaign, at that time, and criticized the then-Democratic candidate for, in their description , calling Rittenhouse a ""white supremacist."" During an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Nov. 22, Rittenhouse himself said Biden had acted with ""actual malice, defaming my character"": Snopes has reviewed footage related to two instances in which Biden referred to Rittenhouse during the 2020 presidential campaign. Our conclusion is that Biden did not explicitly describe the Illinois man as a ""white supremacist."" However, Biden clearly suggested that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist or, at the very least, had substantial links with white supremacists and/or armed militias. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""Mostly True."" CNN Interview Biden conducted an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Aug. 27, 2020 — two days after the Rittenhouse shootings in Kenosha, which took place in the backdrop of a renewed wave of protests after police in the city shot and seriously injured Jacob Blake , a 29-year-old Black man. The relevant section of the conversation can be watched below, and the following is an excerpted transcript: Cooper: The president has not talked about the shooting of Mr. Blake. He's talked about violence at protests in the wake of it. I'm wondering why you think that is that he hasn't actually addressed it? There's obviously a lot we do not know about the circumstances around it, but the video, obviously, has been out there. Biden: Well look, I don't know enough to know whether that 17-year-old kid — exactly what he did. But allegedly he's part of a militia coming out of the state of Illinois. Have you ever heard this president say one negative thing about white supremacists? Have you ever heard it?... In that response, Biden made one explicit factual claim about Rittenhouse — ""allegedly he's part of a militia"" — which was immediately followed by remarks about former President Trump and white supremacists. The clear sense from the totality of Biden's remarks, then, was that Rittenhouse is a white supremacist or, at the very least, he's a militia member with substantial links to white supremacists — claims that Rittenhouse subsequently explicitly denied in his post-trial interview on Fox News. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden now stood by the way in which he characterized Rittenhouse during his CNN interview, or if he wished to retract or modify those remarks. We did not receive a response in time for publication. Biden Campaign Ad During the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, 2020, Biden and Trump clashed over the Republican incumbent's support among white supremacist groups, with Fox News moderator Chris Wallace pressing the president to ""condemn white supremacist and militia groups."" That exchange — which we covered in considerable detail at the time — produced the famous ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by"" moment, and prompted many critics of Trump to accuse him of ""refusing"" to distance himself from white supremacists and far-right militia groups. The following day, Biden's campaign produced an ad that highlighted that explosive moment from the previous evening's debate. It contained audio of the three-way exchange between Wallace, Trump, and Biden, overlaid with video footage and still images of various high-profile instances of white supremacist violence. An excerpted transcript is available here: Chris Wallace (addressing Trump): — but are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacist and militia groups — Trump: Sure Wallace: — and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, and as we’ve seen in Portland? On the words ""as we saw in Kenosha,"" the campaign video showed a still image of Rittenhouse holding a firearm, taken from the night of the shootings on Aug. 25, 2020: The clear suggestion there was, again, that Rittenhouse was himself a white supremacist militia member, or at the very least was closely associated with such groups — claims that, as we have shown, Rittenhouse has vehemently denied. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden stood by this component of the campaign ad, and whether he regretted the fact that it strongly suggested Rittenhouse was a white supremacist.

Bannon, 67, is charged with one contempt count involving his refusal to appear for a deposition and another involving his refusal to produce documents, despite a subpoena from the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol. An arraignment date has not yet been set in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. As this news circulated on social media, many people noted that Bannon was the first person to be indicted by a grand jury on contempt of Congress charges in nearly 40 years. Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard, wrote on Twitter : ""Bannon’s is the first indictment for criminal contempt of Congress in nearly 40 years. It was well earned."" Legal analyst Elie Honig made a similar observation on CNN: While the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate both have the power to certify contempt citations, it is up to the DOJ to pursue criminal prosecution. The Congressional Research Services writes : ""The criminal contempt statute permits a single house of Congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena."" The House and Senate have both voted in recent years to hold various people in contempt of congress — such as former Attorney General William Barr, former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and former Attorney General Eric Holder — but it hasn't been since 1983 that the DOJ indicted someone (in that case, Rita M. Lavelle , a former Environmental Protection Agency official) for contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena to testify about the EPA's hazardous waste cleanup fund. While Lavelle was later cleared of this charge, she was later found guilty of perjury . The New York Times writes : ""The last person charged with criminal contempt of Congress, Rita M. Lavelle, a former federal environmental official under President Ronald Reagan, was found not guilty in 1983 of failing to appear at a congressional subcommittee hearing. She was later sentenced to prison for lying to Congress."" To find the last person found guilty of contempt of Congress charges, you have to go back another decade to 1974, when G. Gordon Liddy, a Watergate conspirator, was convicted of the charge. 10 May 1974, Fri Press-Telegram (Long Beach, California) Newspapers.com Bannon is the first person to be indicted on contempt of Congress charges since 1983, and he could become the first person to be found guilty of those charges since 1974. The DOJ noted in its release that ""all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."" If Bannon is found guilty, he'll face a maximum sentence of one year in jail for each charge. Each count of contempt of Congress carries a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year in jail, as well as a fine of $100 to $1,000. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

As this rumor went viral (one post from Starlight Miriam has nearly 8 million views , another from Drippy Peanut has 12 million ), another set of videos showing a very similar scene — students carrying books in items other than backpacks — was circulated on social media attached to a different claim: that this was part of a senior prank called ""No Backpack Day."" So what's the truth behind these videos? Do these videos show a school attempting to implement a ban on backpacks to prevent school shootings? Or are these humorous videos showing school day hijinks? Here's what we found. Jefferson School District 251 In September 2021, Jefferson School District 251 in Idaho banned backpacks after a gun was found in the backpack of a 13-year-old girl at Rigby Middle School. According to East Idaho News , this was the second gun-related incident at the school this year. On Sept. 23, Jefferson School District 251 banned backpacks in its secondary schools in the hours after deputies took an emotionally struggling 13-year-old girl into custody after finding a gun in her backpack. It marked the second gun incident at the school after a sixth-grade student opened fire with a handgun in May, where two students and a custodian were shot, but not killed. A few of the videos that went viral truly showed students in this school district improvising ways to carry their books after backpacks were banned. In the video below, there's a brief glimpse of the school's gymnasium. This is the same gym floor used at Rigby High School . Jefferson School District 251 Superintendent Chad Martin addressed the viral videos, saying that it was good to see the kids turning this into a positive thing. “I think that all kids need to be able to deal with things and I think they are dealing with it ... We hope (the backpack ban) is a temporary thing until we get a more permanent fix. If this can be a positive thing that they enjoy for a little bit, that’s wonderful.” Brazil's 'No Backpack Day' Confusingly, while videos from this backpack ban were going viral in the United States, another video showing similar behavior was going viral in Brazil. This video appears to show a sort of ""spirit day"" in which the older students get to make a rule for the younger students. In this case, they decided to ban backpacks for the day. The Reddit user who initially shared this video explained : ""I’ve seen that some people didn’t understand the context, so here it is some explanation: basically the students from the year before those who are about to graduate high school have to do whatever they want, it’s like when you are new in collage."" As best as we can tell, this video was taken at Magistério CEEP Brasílio Machado, a school in the city of Antonina in southern Brazil.

fe07ffb3-3599-494e-914a-c8b25714e6c3,"On Sept. 27, 2021, social media users circulated posts about California supposedly changing its election laws so that officials would automatically mail ballots to every active, registered voter in all future elections. The claim was true. On Sept. 27, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that would permanently force county election departments to mail every active, registered voter a ballot weeks before Election Day, according to legislative records obtained by Snopes. Before his approval, state statutes established such a program — though only temporarily. In the 2020 presidential election and 2021 failed effort to recall Newsom, officials sent all registered voters a ballot ""as a safety measure to counteract pandemic-related disruptions,"" as the governor described in a news release . However, under statutes governing universal voting by mail in those elections, the ballot distribution system would have expired at the end of 2021. According to Assembly Bill 37 : Existing law requires county elections officials to mail a ballot to every registered voter for all elections proclaimed or conducted prior to January 1, 2022. [...] This bill would extend the requirements to mail a ballot to every registered voter to all elections and apply them to all local elections officials. Both the temporary and permeant measures drew sharp criticism from political conservatives, who argued the process of mailing ballots to millions of people could open the door to fraud. [See also from Snopes: Do Mail-In Ballots Increase Risk of Voter Fraud? ] Before Newsom's approval of AB 37, for example, opponents drew attention to how county officials track who is — and who isn't — an active voter, the Los Angeles Times reported . ""Active"" and ""registered"" voters are residents who are legally able to vote; have filled out paperwork to submit their names to the voting registrar; and are reachable via their addresses on file. In a story about the permanent change, the L.A. Times wrote: One persistent criticism focuses on elections officials’ use of a list of inactive voters , those who may still be eligible to vote but haven’t been reachable at their mailing address on file and who haven’t cast ballots in recent elections. In some situations, inactive registrations are canceled after a voter fails to participate in two consecutive federal elections. When errors do occur, critics have insisted without any clear evidence that the mistakes are an indicator of larger, systemic problems. AB 37 stipulates that ballots can’t be mailed to anyone on a county’s inactive voter list. Republican lawmakers sought additional rules for how counties should maintain their lists of active and inactive voters. Those opponents also pushed unsuccessfully for stronger restrictions on who can turn in a completed ballot at designated drop-off sites or polling stations, as well as a shorter window for when ballots postmarked by Election Day can count, the LA Times reported. Supporters, however, believe the law makes voting in elections easier for more people. “Data shows that sending everyone a ballot in the mail provides voters access. And when voters get ballots in the mail, they vote,” Assemblyman Marc Berman, D-Palo Alto, the bill’s author, said during a Senate committee hearing in July 2021, as reported by the Los Angeles Times . That was indeed the case after California officials mailed every registered voter a ballot in the 2020 presidential election between former president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. Almost 17.8 million people turned in completed ballots, according to the L.A. Times. That number accounted for about 71% of eligible voters, or the highest such percentage since 1951. “Last year we took unprecedented steps to ensure all voters had the opportunity to cast a ballot during the pandemic and today we are making those measures permanent after record-breaking participation in the 2020 presidential election,” Newsom said in the Sept. 27 release. With Newsom's approval of AB 37, California joined a handful of other U.S. states with the same type of programs, including Utah, Washington, Oregon, and Colorado. But, as the L.A. Times' story noted, no other state’s effort is comparable due to California's population and the law's scope.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,782

In Sept. 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order saying that all federal employees would have to be vaccinated by Nov. 22, 2021. Another order required vaccinations of all contractors who did business with the federal government. According to the White House website : Building on the President’s announcement in July to strengthen safety requirements for unvaccinated federal workers, the President has signed an Executive Order to take those actions a step further and require all federal executive branch workers to be vaccinated. The President also signed an Executive Order directing that this standard be extended to employees of contractors that do business with the federal government. Conservative website The Blaze reported that this meant that members of Congress and their staff did not fall under this mandate. This is correct. The vaccine mandate refers to employees working in the executive branch of government. This covers the president, the vice president, and their offices, which include their advisors and staffers, the cabinet appointed by the president, and heads of various federal agencies. The mandate covers federal agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Treasury, and more. The armed forces are also included in the executive branch. According to the White House , the total number of people employed in this branch are 4 million. The legislative and judicial branches are separate from the executive branch, and do not fall under this vaccine mandate. Biden also cannot mandate as president that all Americans get vaccinated. That is up to each state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in April 2021, “We cannot require someone to be vaccinated.  That's just not what we can do.  It is a matter of privacy to know who is or who isn't. I can't go to the Capitol Physician and say, ‘Give me the names of people who aren't vaccinated, so I can go encourage them or make it known to others to encourage them to be vaccinated.’  So we can't – we can't do that.” In August, a group of House Democrats called on the Capitol physician to institute a vaccine mandate for House members. In early August 2021 , Pelosi said that Congress would follow the guidance of Capitol Physician Brian Monahan. She added, “In a matter of days or weeks, the full approval [from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] will be given to the vaccines, that I think will make a difference in terms of what we can do.” That approval came through on Aug. 23, 2021. In July 2021, Monahan issued an indoor mask mandate for House members and their staffs. This did not extend to the Senate. A vaccination mandate still hasn’t been enforced in Congress.

According to the Chattanooga Times Free Press, the billboard was on Highway 27 in the city of Fort Oglethorpe, which is in Georgia, but was removed on Sept. 13, 2021. It contained a portion of a prophetic Bible verse from the book of Isaiah, and a picture of Trump, leading some to conclude that the billboard likened Trump with a deity, if not Jesus.

The verse is a familiar one, and as the Free Times Press editor Clint Cooper pointed out, ""Christians and biblical scholars believe the words prophesy the coming of Jesus Christ."" In fact, as Cooper further pointed out, the verse is the chorus to Handel's ""Messiah."" Romans 8:17 reads , ""And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together."" We reached out to Reagan, the billboard company listed on the bottom of the sign, asking why it was taken down, and will update if we receive a response.

7333fc48-dfaa-4f95-936b-30d4fb0d4bba,"In the days following the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, Snopes readers asked us to determine the validity of a viral photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Joe Biden pulling down his mask to yell something at a ceremony to honor the attacks' victims. A Sept. 13, 2021, column by Newsweek's editorial board claimed: At the 20th anniversary memorial for 9/11, top Democratic politicians all wore masks for a photo op. Then, as soon as the television cameras were off, the masks came off. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Gov. Kathy Hochul are masked one minute, unmasked and talking the next. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has hers off. President Biden even pulls his mask down to yell at someone. The idiocy. For the purpose of this fact check, we'll focus on the simple assertion: that the president briefly removed his COVID-19 facial covering to communicate something at a 9/11 memorial service. The claim stemmed from a real event that took place at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in Lower Manhattan, where the World Trade Center towers once stood. On Sept. 11, 2021, officials including Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton gathered there for a memorial service that included a moment of silence and name-reading of victims, as reported by multiple reputable news outlets . And it was true that, while standing in the crowd, Biden on at least two occasions temporarily pulled down his mask to communicate something, according to photographic evidence. Considering that verified proof to substantiate the claim, we rate this claim ""True."" Getty Images photographers Chip Somodevilla and Ed Jones documented the moments in a series of photographs from the event, including those displayed in the following tweet. Within that group of photos, the the most controversial image (the featured photograph of this report) included the below-transcribed caption in Getty Images' database: NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 11: President Joe Biden (C) calls out as he is joined by (L-R) former President Bill Clinton, former First Lady Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former First Lady Michelle Obama, First Lady Jill Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, during the annual 9/11 Commemoration Ceremony at the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum on September 11, 2021 in New York City. During the ceremony six moments of silence were held, marking when each of the World Trade Center towers was struck and fell and the times corresponding to the attack on the Pentagon and the crash of Flight 93. The nation is marking the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, when the terrorist group al-Qaeda flew hijacked airplanes into the World Trade Center, Shanksville, PA and the Pentagon, killing nearly 3,000 people. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) In other words, according to at least one reputable photojournalist who witnessed the scene, Biden indeed removed his mask to ""call out"" something while attending the commemoration event. However, the reasons why — or circumstances under which — Biden made the gesture were not made clear by that item of reporting. Also unclear was when, exactly, the moment occurred: before the ceremony began, during its activities, or after its closing. We reached out to Somodevilla for the answers to those questions, and we will update this report when, or if, we hear back from the photojournalist. Meanwhile, we obtained C-SPAN's live recording of the day's multiple commemoration ceremonies. Roughy 1.5 hours in, the footage showed Biden and his entourage walking in to the event at ground zero. Then, over the course of minutes, cameras from various angles focused on him and other politicians greeting members of the crowd. During those conversations before the service's start, Biden pulled down his mask to apparently say something to people around him, the footage showed. That split-second moment, which Jones captured via the below-displayed photo, was separate from the instance mentioned above based on Biden's positioning in the crowd (next to first lady Jill Biden and the Obamas). (Photo by Ed Jones-Pool/Getty Images) Shortly after that gesture, the C-SPAN footage showed, the crowd including the politicians assembled to mark the beginning of the memorial service with a flag ceremony and the Star-Spangled Banner . (The video recording did not include the other moment of Biden temporarily removing his mask captured by Somodevilla.) To conclude our research, we reached out to the White House. Our inquiry included a link to Somodevilla's photo showing Biden ""calling out"" something with his mask away from his face, and the explicit questions: What was the president saying in that moment, specifically, and to whom, or what, was he saying it? In sum, it was true the president temporarily pulled down his mask at least twice at a gathering to honor 9/11 victims, and, in one instance, a reputable photojournalist said he ""called out"" an unspecified word or phrase. However, what the president said in both moments, and with whom or what he was communicating, were unknown. Also undetermined was when — either before, during, or after commemoration activities — the photographs were taken.

ea2a43bb-a5c3-43f0-a68f-e7d90e2dbac6,"Origin Activists from the hacker collective Anonymous took down the website of the Texas Republican Party in protest against a restrictive law that has the effect of banning most abortions. The law, SB8, which took effect on Sept. 1, 2021, bans abortions at about six weeks. The enforcement mechanism laid out in the law allows any private citizen to sue ""any person"" who performs such abortions, or ""aids or abets"" them. The law blocks access to an estimated 85 to 90% of medical system-provided abortion services, and provides no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest. The law was overwhelmingly backed by Texas Republicans and signed by the state's Republican governor, Greg Abbott. In response, Anonymous announced a campaign, dubbed ""Operation Jane,"" to render data collected in efforts to report abortions useless. As part of that campaign, Anonymous hackers took down the Texas GOP's website and replaced it with, among other things, an X-rated image of a man stretching out his anus. (There is an archived version of the hacked website , but view with caution: It is graphic.) Hackers also replaced the state GOP's mission statement with one that read, in part, ""WE REALLY REALLY LOVED THE HANDMAID'S TALE AND WISH TO ENACT IT TO IT'S FULLEST. FOOTBALL!!!!!!"" Texas Republicans acknowledged the vandalism with a statement on their website claiming it prompted them to ramp up their online security. The statement was accompanied by fields allowing website visitors to enter their payment card information and make a donation. The statement reads, in part, ""Stand with us now against these cyber criminals and their brazen attacks by rushing a contribution to harden our digital defenses."" Just days after the law went into effect, a website launched by the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life which was intended for reporting abortions that violated the new law was taken offline by domain host GoDaddy after a public pressure campaign. Anonymous is a loose collective of, as the name states, anonymous cyber activists who emerged in the late aughts to support popular protest movements like the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street. They are known for making ominous videos addressed to their hacking targets ending with the phrase, ""Expect us,"" and wearing Guy Fawkes masks to conceal their identities. Anonymous' presence peaked around the time of the Occupy Wall Street protests, in 2011 and 2012, but died down after a series of high profile arrests . They began to make their presence known again after the murder of George Floyd by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,495
11894d4e-41d1-460b-b076-be89127ff33e,"In September 2021, social media users enthusiastically shared photographs of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) which appeared to show her wearing a dress with the words ""TAX THE RICH"" printed across it. The New York congresswoman, widely known as AOC, purportedly wore the dress at the Met Gala, an exclusive event popular among New York socialites and wealthy and well-connected individuals. For example, on Sep. 13, journalist Ilana Kaplan posted two photographs of AOC to Twitter , one of which showed her wearing a white dress with the words ""TAX THE RICH"" printed across the back in bold red letters. Kaplan described the outfit as ""iconic"": Those pictures were authentic. AOC attended the Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, on Sep. 13. She wore a white dress, designed by the Canadian fashion designer Aurora James, with her political message of choice printed across the back. On Twitter and Instagram , Ocasio-Cortez posted a photograph of herself, wearing the dress, alongside James, along with the following description: The medium is the message. Proud to work with Aurora James as a sustainably focused, Black woman immigrant designer who went from starting her dream at a flea market in Brooklyn to winning the [Council of Fashion Designers of America awards] against all odds - and then work together to kick open the doors at the Met. The time is now for childcare, healthcare, and climate action for all. Tax the Rich. And yes, BEFORE anybody starts wilding out - NYC elected officials are regularly invited to and attend the Met due to our responsibilities in overseeing our city’s cultural institutions that serve the public. I was one of several in attendance... Getty Images also captured dozens of photographs of AOC and her dress at the event, providing further definitive proof of its authenticity:",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,350
ad5ea3c0-dbbc-4b12-a9a1-704c44d62c65,"In September 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the implementation of a controversial Texas state law that effectively bans most abortions, prompting an outraged response among Democrats, pro-choice activists, celebrities, and some sectors of corporate America . Texas Senate Bill (S.B.) 8 , signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on May 19 and implemented on Sept. 1, bans any and all abortions after the ""first detectable heartbeat"" of a fetus, an event that can take place as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It also allows a private citizen to sue any woman who undergoes an abortion after this point, or anyone who assists her, regardless of whether the citizen has any personal connection to those individuals. According to a widely shared Facebook post, one of the major U.S. companies to announce its opposition to the law was the ride-sharing app Lyft. On Sept. 4, Facebook user Izabella Kordalewski posted what appeared to be a screenshot of a letter from the company, addressed to ""Lyft riders and drivers,"" criticizing S.B. 8 as ""incompatible with people's basic rights to privacy."" The letter also promised to provide financial assistance to Lyft drivers who become caught up in the enforcement of the law by transporting women who are on their way to obtain an abortion, in potential violation of S.B. 8. Kordalewski introduced the letter by writing, ""Dear friends. Here is a screenshot of an email I received from Lyft yesterday. Go make good choices."" The letter itself read as follows: Dear Lyft Riders and Drivers, A new Texas law, SB8, threatens to punish drivers for getting people where they need to go - specifically, women exercising their right to choose and to access the healthcare they need. We want to be clear: Drivers are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Imagine being a driver and not knowing if you are breaking the law by giving someone a ride. Similarly, riders never have to justify, or even share, where they are going and why. Imagine being a pregnant woman trying to get to a healthcare appointment and not knowing if your driver will cancel on you for fear of breaking a law. Both are completely unacceptable. This law is incompatible with people’s basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare, and our values as a company. We are taking action on two fronts: Lyft has created a Driver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. Riders and Drivers: Nothing about how you drive, ride or interact with each other should change. TX SB8 is an attack on women’s right to choose. Lyft is donating $1 million to Planned Parenthood to help ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. If you feel compelled to join us as an individual, you can make a donation here. That letter was entirely authentic, so we are issuing a rating of ""True."" On Sept. 3, Lyft shared the letter on its own website , stipulating that it was signed by co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer, as well as the company's general counsel, Kristin Sverchek. The link included in Kordalewski's screenshot directed readers to a Planned Parenthood donation page.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,628

01cf846c-2b70-4325-8aa6-f1acab010f2e,"A statement ostensibly uttered by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina started to recirculate on social media after the Republican senator delivered an emotional, angry, and dramatic defense of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during a hearing concerning sexual assault allegations against the nominee in September 2018. Some social media users were taken aback by Graham's performance in defense of President Trump's nominee, as they remembered a time when the senator was highly critical of Donald Trump as a politician: ""If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed ... and we will deserve it"" is a genuine quote from Senator Graham that was originally posted to his official Twitter account on 3 May 2016. A screenshot of the tweet, which is still available on Graham's timeline as of this writing, can be seen below: This tweet was posted the day before Donald Trump became the Republican party's presumptive nominee for President of the United States on 4 May 2016. Prior to this date, Graham, who also ran for president but ended his campaign in December 2015 before the primaries, frequently voiced opinions critical of Donald Trump. For example, Graham repeatedly said that Trump was not qualified to be president and that his involvement in the election process was damaging to the Republican party: Graham struck a more conciliatory tone with Trump after the latter won the Republican party's nomination, and he eventually came out in support of Trump after the election. A number of news outlets, such as Politico , Mashable , New York magazine, the Washington Post , MSNBC , and the New York Times have noted Graham's transition from ""never-Trumper"" to Trump supporter. On 22 June 2018, the conservative Weekly Standard threw their two cents into the conversation: While most Republicans fell in line before the 2016 election, Lindsey Graham -- along with fellow senators Mike Lee, Ben Sasse, John McCain, and Rob Portman -- was a high-profile NeverTrumper on Election Day. ""My party has gone batshit crazy,"" Graham said in a February 2016 speech about Trump. Graham told Fox News that Trump is ""a kook. I think he's crazy. I think he's unfit to be president."" But sometime after the election, Graham became a neo-Trumper. ""You know what concerns me about the American press is this endless, endless attempt to label the president some kind of kook,"" Graham said in November 2017. ""I intend to support him in 2020 without equivocation,"" Graham tells me now. What changed since 2016? A neoconservative, in Irving Kristol's famous formulation, was a liberal who'd been mugged by reality. Neo-Trumpers like Graham, then, are NeverTrumpers who were mugged by—what, exactly? Necessity? Expediency? Sean Hannity? To hear Graham tell it, policy is what changed his mind. ""He's on track to do big things,"" Graham says of the president. ""He built up the military. I campaigned on it. He got out of the Iran deal. I campaigned on it. He's destroying ISIL. I campaigned on it. He's restructuring the tax code and the way we do business. I campaigned on it. He's doing much of what I campaigned on, and I'm pleased."" Graham now speaks regularly with Trump and has become a close ally on matters ranging from North Korea to health care. What about the issues of temperament that in 2016 made Trump, in Graham's view, unfit to be president? Is there anything specific, I ask, that has convinced the senator that Trump isn't the ""kook"" Graham called him back then? ""One, I got to know him,"" Graham says. ""I've played golf with him. You know, play golf with somebody for three or four hours, you get to know them better. He's funny as hell. He's got a great sense of humor.

c1896bf3-fd49-4c47-acbe-59fa311f0738,"Back in 1971, Rep. Tom (not ""Tim"") Moore, Jr. of Waco, Texas — knowing that his fellow legislators in the Texas House of Representatives often passed bills and resolutions without fully reading or understanding them — pulled an April Fool's joke on the House by sponsoring a resolution commending Albert de Salvo for his unselfish service to ""his county, his state and his community."" That resolution read, in part: This compassionate gentleman's dedication and devotion to his work has enabled the weak and the lonely throughout the nation to achieve and maintain a new degree of concern for their future. He has been officially recognized by the state of Massachusetts for his noted activities and unconventional techniques involving population control and applied psychology. The joke, of course, was that Albert de Salvo was more commonly known as the Boston Strangler , assumed to be responsible for the murders of thirteen women in the Boston area between 1962 and 1964. (Technically, de Salvo was never convicted or put on trial for any of those killings — he was sentenced to life in prison for sexual assaults on several other women and confessed to the thirteen murders as well. He was stabbed to death in prison in 1973, and whether he actually committed the murders he confessed to has been a subject of controversy ever since.) As Rep. Moore expected, he saw his resolution passed unanimously; he then withdrew it and explained that he had offered the motion only to demonstrate a point. (A bit of sardonic humor offered at the time claimed that perhaps Moore was wrong: maybe the legislators had been paying attention.) Although we would hope our elected representatives would pay enough attention to their jobs not to pass resolutions commending murderers, that Moore's stunt succeeded wasn't necessarily as outrageous as it might seem. Federal and state legislators see a steady stream of resolutions that have no real legal impact and are offered mostly as public relations measures on behalf of one group or another. Poring over each and every one would take an inordinate amount of a legislator's time (especially in states like Texas where the legislature might be in session only relatively briefly and infrequently, creating a large number of bills and resolutions to be voted upon in a very short time). If a fellow legislator introduces a resolution to honor some favored person or group, you're expected to rubber stamp it as a gesture of good will — after all, you'll want him to return the favor when you need to boost your popularity with your constituents by extending similar honors to some of them.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,487
573870b3-9cd1-4f9f-a9b4-c34e77808910,"On Jan. 7, 2018, Oprah Winfrey was honored with the Cecil B. deMille Award at the Golden Globes and used the opportunity to deliver a speech about women's empowerment, the ""Me Too"" movement, and changes on the horizon. As political pundits speculated that Oprah was eyeing a presidential run (host Seth Meyers even opened the show with an ""Oprah 2020"" joke), others claimed that her message was hypocritical, using a photograph purportedly showing her kissing Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein (who has been accused of sexual assault by several high-profile women) as proof : The photograph of Oprah kissing Harvey Weinstein is real, although it was taken several years before Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct was made public; it was taken at the 19th Annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards in January 2014 by photographer Kevin Mazur, and it is available here via Getty Images. Others took the criticism of Winfrey a step further, claiming that the photograph actually shows the famous television host nibbling or sucking on Weinstein's ear: The first rule of Anti-Sexual Assault Club is to not put a sexual assaulter's earlobe in your mouth at the head table. Am I the first person on planet Earth to blow up this picture? Ewww!! We compared this blown-up image with the photograph from Getty, and it does not appear to be doctored, but neither is it proof that his earlobe was actually in her mouth. The photograph, as best as we can tell, shows Oprah kissing Weinstein near his ear, not suckling it. We also examined contemporary reports on the 2014 Critics Choice Awards and couldn't find any mention of Winfrey and Weinstein engaging in inappropriate canoodling during the awards show, something that surely would have made the gossip pages if it had been true. However, even if this were true, it still would have been long before Weinstein was outed and ostracized as an alleged serial predator. Although Harvey Weinstein became the face of sexual harassment at the end of 2017, that was not the case in 2014. At that time, he was known mostly as a prolific producer who had worked with a number of well-respected actors and actresses. There certainly is much to be said about how an alleged predator was able to have a successful decades-long career (especially since this was apparently an "" open secret ""), but it is unclear whether Oprah knew about it at that time. What we do know, however, is that she called Weinstein's behavior ""hideous"" in an October 2017 statement : I've been processing the accounts of Harvey Weinstein's hideous behavior and haven't been able to find the words to articulate the magnitude of the situation. Filmmaker James Schamus captured so much of what I've been feeling when he said: ""This is the story of one predator and his many victims; but it is also a story about an overwhelming systemic enabling, and until that story is fully told we will fall far short of stopping future depredations on a similar scale."" https://w ww.hollywoodreporter.com/…/filmmaker-james-schamus-… Thanks to the brave voices we've heard this week, many more will now be emboldened to come forward EVERY time this happens. I believe a shift is coming. This is not the first time that Weinstein's behavior has been used to attempt to smear a celebrity retroactively. A doctored photograph attempting to make it appear as though showing President Barack Obama bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on the producer also made the usual fake-news rounds just after stories about him began to appear in October 2017.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,666
4cfe3940-f88d-4b8c-a1af-3d90cd072759,"In January 2019, as political tensions rose over funding for President Donald Trump's proposed border wall, reports emerged that an undocumented immigrant had been responsible for four killings in Nevada. On Jan. 21, 2021, President Trump himself tweeted that ""Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country,"" and used the case in support of his argument for the enhanced security infrastructure along the southern border, adding ""We need a powerful Wall!"": Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country. 26 people killed on the Border in a drug and gang related fight. Two large Caravans from Honduras broke into Mexico and are headed our way. We need a powerful Wall! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 21, 2019 President Trump and some of his supporters have consistently talked up the supposed risk to public safety from immigration across the southern U.S. border. However, studies have repeatedly shown that undocumented immigrants actually commit crimes, including violent crimes, at a lower rate than native-born U.S. citizens, as we have outlined in greater detail previously. The day after Trump's tweet, the conservative ""Constitution Club"" Facebook page posted a widely-shared meme featuring a photograph of an elderly Nevada couple alleged to have been killed by the ""illegal immigrant"" in question: ""REST IN PEACE: Gerold [sic] (81) and Sharon David (80), shot and killed by an illegal immigrant during a home invasion/robbery in Reno on 1/10/19."" In October 2021, nearly three years after this fact check was originally published, Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman pleaded guilty to several charges, including the murders of Gerald and Sharon David, just as the meme claimed. Federal immigration officials confirmed for Snopes that Martinez-Guzman is an unauthorized immigrant in the United States. As a result, we have changed the rating on this fact check from ""Unproven"" to ""True."" Background On Jan. 19, 2019, the Carson City Sheriff's Office arrested Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman, a citizen of El Salvador, in connection with a series of burglaries and homicides in Washoe and Douglas Counties in January 2019. Initial police statements described the suspect as being 19 years old, but Carson City Sheriff's Office records list his age as 20. Martinez-Guzman was suspected of being responsible for the shooting deaths of 56-year-old Connie Koontz on Jan. 10, 2019, 74-year-old Sophia Renken on Jan. 13, and Gerald David (81) and his wife Sharon David (80) on Jan. 16. A spokesperson for the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) confirmed to Snopes that Martinez-Guzman is an undocumented immigrant, writing in an email to us that: ""Mr. Martinez-Guzman is a citizen of El Salvador who entered the United States unlawfully on an unknown date and location. He has no prior criminal or immigration history. ICE has lodged a detainer."" ICE files a detainer request with a local law enforcement agency when they have reason to believe that an individual is eligible to be deported from the United States, and ICE formally asks that agency to notify ICE in advance of the individual's release from custody (for example, after serving a prison sentence) so that ICE can then immediately take the person into custody and begin the deportation process. Martinez-Guzman was initially charged in Carson City with burglary and possession of stolen property in relation to his alleged actions at the David household in South Reno, as well as immigration offences. At the time this fact check was originally published, in January 2019, he had not been charged with murder, but local law enforcement officials said they were ""confident [they] have evidence that will link him to all four homicides."" On Jan. 24, 2019, the Carson City District Attorney added several additional charges. According to KOLO-TV , those new charges included: 12 new counts of possession of a stolen firearm, including rifles, shotguns and one handgun belonging to Gerald and Sharon David. Two counts possession of stolen property – an Apple watch belonging to Connie Koontz, plus golf club and tools belonging to another Carson City burglary victim. Twelve counts of prohibited person in possession of a firearm. Two misdemeanor counts of possession of stolen property, rings belonging to Connie Koontz. Three misdemeanor counts of obtaining money under false pretenses for the sale of two rings belonging to Connie Koontz, one belonging to Gerald David. On Oct. 21, 2021, after a series of delays, Martinez-Guzman pleaded guilty to several charges against him in Washoe County, Nevada, including the murders of Gerald and Sharon David. In return, prosecutors there have agreed not to request the death penalty at sentencing, but instead will ask the court to hand down a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Washoe County District Attorney's office provided Snopes with a copy of the guilty plea memo signed by Martinez-Guzman. In it, he agreed to plead guilty to six felonies including burglary and first degree murder, and also committed to pleading guilty to similar crimes in Douglas County, where he is being prosecuted for the shooting deaths of Koontz and Renken. If Martinez-Guzman fails to also plead guilty to the murders of Koontz and Renken in Douglas County, under the terms of his plea agreement he would once again leave himself open to the death penalty in both jurisdictions.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1022
7ec53a60-d08c-48e2-826f-8507ec60441a,"In July 2020, Snopes received numerous inquiries from people who said they had heard U.S. President Donald Trump's administration issued a proposal to change federal law governing homeless shelters and that that memo included an explanation for how to spot some transgender people so the facilities could deny them housing. Many readers included a link to an LGBTQ Nation article published July 20, 2020. People on social media circulated the same claim and link, criticizing the alleged memo as yet another example of the Trump administration's discriminatory tactics to oppress a population that's already at high risk of homelessness. The LGBTQ Nation story alleges the federal memo ""says homeless shelters can use 'factors such as height, the presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an Adam's apple' to spot trans women"" during the intake process. Yes, a proposal sponsored by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson did list those physical attributes verbatim (see below): Now, let's investigate why — was the language intended to help homeless shelters spot transgender people seeking services? First, to explore that question, we researched the circumstances under which the Trump administration was most likely to have written the alleged document. We learned via a July 1, 2020, HUD press release Carson had recently written a proposal to amend existing guidelines that govern how federally funded homeless shelters operate, and we deemed that initiative to be the most likely source of the claim's inspiration. The press release stated: Carson today announced a proposed modification to the 2016 portion of the Equal Access rule. The Equal Access rule requires all HUD funded housing services to be provided without discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The new rule allows shelter providers that lawfully operate as single-sex or sex-segregated facilities to voluntarily establish a policy that will govern admissions determinations for situations when an individual’s gender identity does not match their biological sex. Some context: Housing officials under former U.S. President Barack Obama originally established the Equal Access rule, which requires homeless shelters and other facilities that receive money through the HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development to give Americans equal access to services, regardless of their gender identity or other characteristics. Carson's proposal primarily targeted homeless shelters and facilities within that group that keep beds, bathrooms or other spaces separate for men and women for both emergency and longer-term stays. His measure would have given those places the legal authority to establish rules so only people whose biological sex corresponds with that of what the shelter serves would be granted access to services, no matter how people identify. Next, we obtained the memo to which the LGBTQ Nation headline and press release were referring: a 29-page document on HUD's official website titled ""Making Admission or Placement Determinations Based on Sex in Facilities Under Community Planning and Development Housing Programs."" The docket was signed by Carson, a former neurosurgeon whom Trump appointed to lead HUD in 2016. The document details the specifics of his proposal, as well as his rationale for introducing it, amid a series of unrelated initiatives by the Trump administration to weaken federal protections for transgender Americans. The in-question measure would have changed existing guidelines that, the document alleged, Obama's administration enacted in violation of administrative law and ""minimized local control, burdened religious organizations, manifested privacy issues, and imposed regulatory burdens."" The proposal read: If a single-sex facility permissibly provides accommodation for women, and its policy is to serve only biological women, without regard to gender identity, it may decline to accommodate a person who identifies as female but who is a biological male. Conversely, the same shelter may not, on the basis of sex, decline to accommodate a person who identifies as male but who is a biological female. A different shelter may choose not to make placement decisions or accommodations based on biological sex and there remains no mandate that shelters take biological sex into account. At one point, the document implied that the existing Equal Access rule — requiring facilities nationwide to provide housing, regardless of incoming residents' gender identities — posed a danger to shelter residents; an argument that appeared to be rooted in the unsubstantiated and transphobic claim that men with nefarious intentions might pose as trans women and gain access to female facilities to stalk or harass women. However, the document did not explain how or under what circumstances HUD came to that assumption, nor did it provide verifiable instances of that happening, aside from a pending lawsuit in Fresno, California, that alleges a shelter there allowed such behavior. The HUD proposal stated: [The] current rule makes it impracticable for some shelters to, after admitting a biological male, adequately protect the privacy interests of their biological female clientele who do not want to shower, undress, and sleep in the same facilities as biological men. Pending whatever shelters decide for their entry policies under the proposal, the document stated, staff at facilities that are designed to exclusively serve men or women would ask incoming residents their gender identities before giving them beds. In those cases, if intake workers had ""good faith"" to believe someone was presenting as male or female but that gender did not correspond with their birth sex — which is literally the definition of being transgender — and that birth sex was not served by the shelter, the staff could turn them away. It was at that point in the docket HUD wrote: HUD believes that reasonable considerations [for determining whether a person is transgender] may include, but are not limited to a combination of factors such as height, the presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an Adam’s apple, and other physical characteristics which, when considered together, are indicative of a person’s biological sex. In sum, it is accurate to state that under the leadership of Trump, HUD issued a memo in July 2020 that outlined steps for staff at federally funded homeless shelters to determine whether or not incoming residents were transgender, and given the language — it listed masculine physical features and how to notice them, presumably in circumstances when trans women are seeking housing at female-only shelters — we rate this claim ""True."" However, this fact was key: The measure regarding homeless shelters' entry guidelines never took hold at facilities. Federal leaders were still debating the proposal at the time of the November 2020 election. And after voters elected Democratic candidate Joe Biden over Trump, Biden's HUD Secretary, Marcia Fudge, withdrew the Trump-era measure from consideration. Fudge said in an April 2021 statement : Unfortunately, transgender and gender non-conforming people report more instances of housing instability and homelessness than cisgender people. Today, we are taking a critical step in affirming HUD’s commitment that no person be denied access to housing or other critical services because of their gender identity.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1298
53094482-15f5-4766-8ab1-3a482e3a4eae,"In July 2020, readers asked us to examine the accuracy of news articles that claimed 20-year-old Ohio man Isaiah Jackson had been arrested in connection with a photograph, shared widely online, which showed a Black man kneeling on a white toddler's neck, along with the caption ""BLM now mf."" On July 23, the New York Post published an article with the headline ""Ohio Man Seen Kneeling on 2-Year-Old Boy's Neck Arrested."" The article reported that: ""An Ohio man seen kneeling on the neck of a 2-year-old boy on social media has been arrested, authorities said Thursday. Isaiah Jackson, 20, was booked into jail on a probation violation after the Clark County Sheriff’s Office launched an investigation Tuesday into the photo, which depicts a man with his knee on the back of a white child neck’s along with a caption, 'Blm now mf.' A second person is also seen behind the child holding the youngster’s hands behind his back."" Similar articles were published by the Washington Times and local news channels WHIO and WKEF/WRGT . The core claim in those reports -- that Jackson was identified by police as the man in the photograph, and that he had been arrested in connection with it -- was accurate. When this fact check was first published in July 2020, Jackson had not been charged or convicted in relation to the incident shown in the photograph. However, since then, prosecutors in Clark County, Ohio, charged Jackson with third-degree felony abduction, to which he pleaded guilty. In October 2020, a judge sentenced Jackson to three years of community control probation. Technically speaking, police originally arrested Jackson on the basis of an alleged unrelated parole violation, though they sought him out and located him during their investigation into the photograph, and Jackson subsequently pleaded guilty to a third-degree felony abduction charge in relation to the actions shown in the photograph. This fact check's rating was originally ""Mostly True,"" but in light of developments that took place after the article was originally published, we are changing the rating to ""True."" Analysis Internet users began sharing the photograph on July 21, 2020. It appears to have originally been posted to an unidentified Snapchat account. The image shows a man posing for the camera while kneeling on the back of the neck of a toddler who appears to be crying and is lying face down while a second adult holds the toddler's hands behind his back. At the bottom of the photograph, a banner caption reads ""Blm now mf"" (""Black Lives Matter now, motherfucker."") The photograph may be disturbing to some readers, but it can be viewed here . On July 23, the Clark County Sheriff's Office announced in a statement that its investigations into the photograph had led them to identify 20-year-old Isaiah Jackson as the man seen kneeling on the toddler, and that he had been arrested on the basis of an outstanding parole detainer, meaning he was alleged to have violated the conditions of his parole in relation to a separate case. The statement read: On July 21, 2020, the Clark County Sheriff's Office was made aware of a posting on social media displaying a photo of an adult male in a kneeling position, with one knee on the neck of a 2 year old child. Appended to the photo was a 'banner' containing language that indicated that the image was related to ongoing racially-oriented protests and other activity taking place in various cities around the nation. Two divisions of the Clark County Sheriff's Office immediately began an investigation to determine the location of the incident and the identities of the individuals involved. Patrol units were able to determine the location where the incident took place, and were able to make contact with both the mother and the child, as well as the male subject seen kneeling in the image. The male was determined to have a Parole Authority holder from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, and he was taken immediately into custody and incarcerated in the Clark County Jail. The child was taken to the local hospital for examination, where he was found to have no injuries related to the incident. Subsequent interview with the mother revealed that she was unaware of the photo having been taken, or its contents, until she had been informed by other parties while the Sheriff's Office was en route to her home to begin the investigation into this incident. Detectives continue to investigate, and are continuing to compile evidence related to several other persons who were directly involved. The Investigations Bureau of the Clark County Sheriff's Office has prepared the case against the male subject shown in the photo, Isaiah Jackson, 20, and is awaiting the Office of the County Prosecutor to provide a determination on the scope and breadth of the felony charges that will be supported by that office for presentation in court. Clark County Sheriff's Office records showed that Jackson was arrested at 10:50 a.m. on July 21 and booked into the county jail some 15 minutes later. Those records indicated that he was arrested on the basis of a probation violation but it was, in fact, an alleged parole violation, according to the Sheriff's Department's news release. As of July 27, Jackson was still incarcerated in the county jail. It's unclear what the nature of Jackson's alleged parole violation was, or what conviction it related to. However, Clark County Court of Common Pleas records show that in January 2019, Jackson pleaded guilty to charges of third-degree felony burglary and first-degree misdemeanor domestic violence. He was sentenced to six months in prison on the domestic violence charge, to be served concurrently with an 18-month sentence on the burglary charge, with credit for time already served. According to Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction records , Jackson was released from the Madison Correctional Institution on May 17, 2020, but placed under Adult Parole Authority supervision for a period of three years. Snopes asked the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction for the details surrounding the alleged parole violation that prompted Jackson's arrest in Clark County, and we will update this fact check if and when we receive a response. Jackson's domestic violence conviction related to an incident in September 2018 in which he was found to have deliberately rammed his truck into a car he knew was being driven by a woman with whom he has a daughter in common. The arresting officer in the case testified that the woman had said Jackson was ""becoming [increasingly] aggressive and violent with her, threatening her and her family."" The photograph and Jackson's arrest quickly became the subject of intensive, racially tinged outrage and discussion because the caption that accompanied the photograph mentioned the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, and due to the perceived racial dynamics at play (Jackson's race was listed as ""Black"" in Clark County Sheriff's Department records, and the toddler was widely described as being white, although we could not verify that claim). However, it's unknown whether the pose was intended as an earnest gesture of anti-white bias or antipathy on Jackson's part, as opposed to a distasteful attempt at humor. Our examination of a Facebook profile that appears to belong to Jackson did not reveal further evidence of racial antipathy on his part. Despite a rush, from some quarters, to condemn the Black Lives Matter movement by association with Jackson, our research did not uncover evidence of any earnest involvement in, or even commentary on, the broader Black Lives Matter movement, racial injustice or police brutality, on the part of Jackson. After this fact check was published, Snopes obtained a copy of police reports from the Clark County Sheriff's Office investigation into the incident. They showed that a third party, not Jackson himself, had claimed responsibility for posting the photograph online, and adding the ""Blm now mf"" caption. In addition, Jackson told investigating officers that his actions were intended only as a joke, but acknowledged that the pose shown in the photograph was an allusion to the death of George Floyd, in Minneapolis, in May 2020. In that incident, police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on the back of Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, despite the pleas of Floyd and onlookers. Two autopsies concluded that Chauvin's actions led to Floyd's death, which sparked renewed nationwide and international protests against police brutality and racial injustice led by the Black Lives Matter movement. In April 2021, a jury in Hennepin County, Minnesota found Chauvin guilty of three charges : second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. After the conclusion of the police investigation, Clark County prosecutors charged Jackson with third-degree felony abduction in August 2020, citing an Ohio statute which states that: No person, without privilege to do so, shall knowingly... (2) By force or threat, restrain the liberty of another person under circumstances that create a risk of physical harm to the victim or place the other person in fear...

6e133f53-30e9-4a4f-8a8c-8232b7567b42,"On Aug. 24, 2019, a 23-year-old Black man named Elijah McClain was walking home from the store when he was stopped by police officers in Aurora, Colorado (part of the Denver metropolitan area), after they received a report of a ""suspicious person"" wearing a ski mask. The encounter escalated, McClain was put in a chokehold, and a few days later he was dead. The Denver Post reported : Elijah McClain, 23, was walking home from a store around 10:30 p.m. on a Saturday evening when authorities contacted him near Billings Street and Colfax Avenue in Denver. Someone had called 911 to report a “suspicious person” who was wearing a ski mask and waving his arms. McClain routinely wore masks when he was outside because he had anemia — a blood condition — and became cold easily, according to his family. [...] After a struggle, McClain was handcuffed and officers requested medical assistance. Aurora Fire Rescue later injected him with ketamine in an attempt to sedate him, police said. He suffered cardiac arrest during the ambulance ride to a nearby hospital. [...] The following Friday McClain was declared “brain dead” and was expected to be taken off life support that afternoon, family members said. He died later that day. McClain's family called for the police officers involved in his death to be prosecuted, but it was announced in November that they would not face criminal charges. McClain's case did not receive the same national attention as other similar incidents, but it was thrust back into the spotlight after George Floyd's death in May 2020, when protests against racial injustice and police violence spread across the United States. In June 2020, an image of text supposedly relaying McClain's ""last words"" started going viral on social media : This message reads: I can't breathe. I have my ID right here. My name is Elijah McClain. That's my house. I was just going home. I'm an introvert. I'm just different. That's all. I'm so sorry. I have no gun. I don't do that stuff. I don't do any fighting. Why are you attacking me? I don't even kill flies! I don't eat meat! But I don't judge people, I don't judge people who do eat meat. Forgive me. All I was trying to do was become better. I will do it. I will do anything. Sacrifice my identity, I'll do it. You all are phenomenal. You are beautiful and I love you. Try to forgive me. I'm a mood Gemini. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Ow, that really hurt. You are all very strong. Teamwork makes the dream work. Oh, I'm sorry I wasn't trying to do that. I just can't breathe correctly. This is a largely accurate transcript of what McClain said in a video recording of his encounter with police in August 2019. These remarks can be heard on the body cam footage of one of the police officers involved in the incident. An official copy of this video from the Aurora Police Department can be seen below (the relevant portion of the video starts at around the 12:30 mark). The text in the viral transcript has been slightly edited to remove repeated phrases and inaudible moments (McClain says ""I'm just different"" multiple times), but none of the edits are misleading. The text describing actions in the viral post — at one point noting that McClain was crying, at another noting that he vomited — are also accurate. This viral transcript does omit at least one phrase uttered by McClain during this encounter. A few moments after the final words of this viral transcript, McClain says ""I can't fix myself"" before vomiting again. NPR reported : Someone picks up a body camera and McClain can be seen lying on his side with both hands restrained behind his back, and one officer jamming his knee on the man's torso. When McClain attempts to roll over to vomit, they shout at him to ""stop fighting us."" ""If you keep messing around, I'm going to bring my dog out here and he's going to bite you,"" says an officer standing over McClain. McClain proceeds to vomit. ""I can't fix myself,"" he says weakly. McClain's body goes limp and he passes out. Eventually one officer asks, ""Are you OK?"" But he's not asking McClain. He's speaking to the officer on top of him. ""Yeah, I'm good,"" the officer says shifting his weight. When paramedics arrived, McClain was injected with ketamine ( described by Aurora Police as ""a standard medication routinely utilized to reduce agitation"") and then loaded into an ambulance where he suffered cardiac arrest. On August 30, McClain was pronounced brain dead, removed from life support, and died. In February 2021, an independent investigation commissioned by the city found that police officers did not have legal basis to stop McClain. The Denver Post reports : Aurora police officers did not have a legal basis to force Elijah McClain to stop walking, to frisk him or to use a chokehold on him, an independent investigation commissioned by the city found. The initial investigation into the incident led by the department's detectives in the Major Crimes Unit was also deeply flawed, the investigators found. The detectives failed to ask basic, critical questions of the officers involved in McClain's death and instead ""the questions frequently appeared designed to elicit specific exonerating 'magic language' found in court rulings,"" the report states. [...] Aurora city officials on Monday morning released the 157-page report on the death of McClain at the hands of city police and paramedics. The city hired a panel of investigators to examine the officers' and paramedics' decision and make policy recommendations ""to lessen the chance of another tragedy like this one from happening again,"" the report states.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1151
02fbd65d-4488-4bdc-ba2d-c33491aa7296,"The remote Rocky Mountain city of Casper, Wyoming, was rumored to be the home of a so-called “wind turbine graveyard,” a large swath of land where retired, non-recyclable wind turbine blades are buried in mass quantities. A social media post that was shared on Facebook nearly 2,000 times in early October 2020 claimed to bring attention and “open your eyes to the environmental issues with windmills” that had been “wasted and decommissioned.” Snopes readers asked our team to investigate the legitimacy of the Wyoming ""wind turbine graveyard,"" which we found to be real and reported on by a number of credible publications in 2020, including Bloomberg and NPR , as well as other publications that have more obvious agendas aimed at stopping the so-called “ great wind power fraud .” (The photos shared in the social media post are also real and can be found on Getty Images here and here .) It is true that there is a landfill in Casper, Wyoming, that does accept decommissioned and damaged wind turbine blades and motors, both of which are not recyclable. However, it is important to highlight that up to 90% of a wind turbine is recyclable. That one-tenth of a windmill is not recyclable does not necessarily negate its overall green energy production over the course of its 20- to 25-year lifetime . Nearly an entire wind turbine can be recycled with the exception of its blades, which are largely made of composite and fiberglass materials and built to withstand some of nature’s most destructive forces, making them very difficult to recycle or crush in the first place. Because the average wind turbine in the United States measures about 280 feet tall , they are prone to environmental and natural damage, such as normal weathering from storm systems with high winds and hail, lightning strikes, and birds. Many wind farms will employ blade service technicians to repair damaged blades. However, when the cost of a repair outweighs its benefit — or the blade is simply not salvageable — they are disposed of in a variety of ways, including being buried. “Wind farms repurpose and recycle 90% of all the materials in a wind turbine; the only material not recyclable is fiberglass; the blades and motor housing are the only fiberglass components,” note Casper city records . City documents published in August 2020 outlined the Casper Regional Landfill (CRL) Wind Turbine and Motor Housing Project, which contains a construction and demolition cell built for special waste projects to generate revenue and keep landfill fees low for regional users. One of the uses of that cell is to house turbine fiberglass blades and motor housing units that are to be disposed of and buried in order to minimize landfill space above ground. CRL first began accepting decommissioned blades in May 2019 and expects to run until spring 2021. According to a Sept. 22, 2020, fact sheet (page 7) submitted to the city by Casper Public Services Director Andrew Beamer and Solid Waste Division Manager Cynthia Langston, the solid waste facility had received 1,124 turbine blades from three neighboring wind farms as of Sept. 16, 2020, totaling approximately $444,000 dollars in revenue for the fiscal year 2020. In the 2021 fiscal year, 250 shorter turbine blades have been received and another 250 are expected, for a total of $35,000 in anticipated revenue. Fiberglass is inert and considered nonhazardous when buried. To save space, the city said that 120-foot-long turbines are cut into three 40-foot lengths and the smaller sections placed within the larger pieces. Each turbine blade is then buried within a cell that measures a maximum of 44 cubic yards, or about the size of about three concrete mixer trucks. As of October 2020, the city of Casper only accepts waste from the state of Wyoming and any out-of-state customer wanting to dispose of blades in CRL would require a permit amendment filed with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,728
beee74a3-0215-4372-8389-247e5032daa2,"The nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett by U.S. President Donald Trump to the U.S. Supreme Court on Sept. 26, 2020, sparked political discourse, debate, and a slew of internet memes and rumors arguing both in favor of and against the conservative legislator. As the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation heated up in mid-October, Snopes readers asked us to verify the authenticity of a letter that was reportedly written by more than 80 Notre Dame colleagues of Barrett asking her to ""halt"" the nomination process in advance of the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election. A link to the letter was shared by a number of public figures on Twitter, including journalist Elizabeth Vargas and MSNBC Anchor Katy Tur , as well as others. This letter is indeed real. The Oct. 10, letter , which was signed by 88 professors at Notre Dame University with disciplines in law, sociology, economics, theater, and political science, among others, expressed concerns over the timing of Barrett's nomination. Barrett is a law school alumna and has taught as a member of the law school's faculty since 2002. Published in Teacher-Scholar-Activist , an online community for American educators to share “local moves that matter in our communities,” the authors went on to say the following: We write to you as fellow faculty members at the University of Notre Dame. We congratulate you on your nomination to the United States Supreme Court. An appointment to the Court is the crowning achievement of a legal career and speaks to the commitments you have made throughout your life. And while we are not pundits, from what we read your confirmation is all but assured. That is why it is vital that you issue a public statement calling for a halt to your nomination process until after the November presidential election. The authors cited three reasons for their request. The first was that the general election is currently underway between Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden, noting the “rushed nature” of Barrett’s nomination process. Trump’s announcement of Barrett’s nomination less than a week after the death of former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an “exercise in raw power politics” that “may effectively deprive the American people of voice in selecting the next Supreme Court Justice.” Secondly, the authors highlighted that Ginsburg’s ""dying wish was that her seat on the court remain open until a new president was installed"" — a request she made in the days preceding her death in which she said that her ""most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed."" Finally, the professors wrote that the nomination comes at a highly politicized era in American politics that includes violence in the streets. Barrett’s confirmation would ""inflame our civic wounds, undermine confidence in the court, and deepen the divide among ordinary citizens."" Though the authors do not explicitly go into detail describing this “violence,” the 2020 election season coincides with months of civil unrest and nationwide protests following the d eath of George Floyd , a Black man who died in Minnesota while being held in police custody, and rising concerns over white supremacy dividing the nation. Supreme Court justices are nominated by the president and are then confirmed by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee through a sometimes lengthy and contentious nomination process. The U.S. Constitution does not specify any qualifications for a justice other than that the candidate must have been trained in law. Once confirmed, a justice will serve until death, as was the case with Ginsburg, who died on Sept. 18, 2020, after serving 27 years on the High Court. Justices have the potential to interpret laws in the country at the highest degree, which some argue may be influenced by their political affiliations, particularly on the heels of the 2020 general election. In her legislative career, Barrett has upheld high-profile court decisions during her time as a circuit judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit , which resides over Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, that some publications contend are controversial and may hinder her ability to be impartial, pushing “the Supreme Court to the right.” Others have argued that her religious ties to a conservative Christian group called People of Praise suggest that she may be swayed in some of her court opinions — particularly those involving access to abortion and women’s rights . Democratic members of the Senate committee argued that the hearings should have been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic and growing concerns over infection rates in the Republican party, particularly within the president’s cabinet . Republican members, on the other hand, highlighted Barrett’s credentials and intellect. In a Twitter thread , White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany countered the Note Dame letter by sharing letters written by ""elected-officials, colleagues, clerks, students and countless others inspired by her work and character."" Oct. 15 marked the fourth and final day of hearings. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to confirm Barrett’s confirmation and the full Senate voted on Oct. 26 to confirm the new justice to the Supreme Court.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,961

In October 2020, an image supposedly showing a meme that was posted to Twitter by U.S. President Donald Trump started to circulate on other social media sites, such as Facebook, where some viewed it with skepticism. One reader asked, ""did Trump tweet this?"" in reference to a meme that featured a digitally manipulated image of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in a nursing home above the words, ""Biden for President"" with the ""P"" crossed out, so it read ""Biden for Resident."" Trump posted the ""Biden for Resident"" meme to his Twitter page on Oct. 13, 2020. Trump did not provide any additional text when he shared this image. While Trump, 74, truly shared a doctored image of his political rival Biden, 77, sitting at a nursing home, it doesn't appear that the president created this meme. The ""Biden for Resident"" image was circulating on social media for a few days — at the least — before it appeared on Trump's timeline. We're not sure who created this meme, but we do know that it was created from a photograph taken by Jeff Greenberg at a nursing home in Morristown, New Jersey circa 1989-90.

3830a340-6d39-4f24-a3f9-634ff88ac91a,"In the lead-up to the 2020 general election, the internet was rife with political memes criticizing many candidates and campaigns. Among them was a widely shared photograph of U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado, at a September GOP event pictured wearing a T-shirt that read, “Kill ‘em all. Let God sort ‘em out.” The above meme was shared to Facebook in a post by Texas Rural Voices , a group that describes itself as rural Texans and has supported Democratic platforms. Readers asked Snopes if the photograph of Buck's shirt was real, and it was. The images were shared by the Colorado GOP’s official Twitter account on Aug. 29, 2020, which we have archived here for reference. ""To be honest, this isn't really a story or newsworthy,"" Joe Jackson, communications director for the Colorado Republican Party, wrote to Snopes in an email. ""The saying on the shirt is well known as being associated with the Marines and Green Berets and the t-shirt was a gift to the Congressman from his son, who is a veteran and went to West Point,"" he added. Jackson included links to Twitter posts shared here , here , here and here to support this claim. Maj Salinas, branch head of media operations for the U.S. Marine Corps, told Snopes that the phrase was “never adopted as an official motto or slogan for the U.S. Marine Corps.” Notably, Buck's T-shirt contains no direct references to the Marine Corps, but it does appear to feature a U.S. Army Special Forces crest insignia . The phrase, ""Kill 'em all. Let God sort 'em out,"" reportedly comes from the Latin saying, ""Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius,"" which translates to, ""Kill them. For the Lord knows those that are His own."" The Latin version of the phrase reportedly dates back to the Albigensian Crusade of the 13th century when Pope Innocent III launched a 20-year military campaign against the Cathari, a religious sect deemed heretics, that is described in an article published in the Annals of Burns and Fire Disasters . When the crusaders asked how they might distinguish true Christians from the heretics, a papal legate reportedly replied with the above phrase, according to a collection of writings known as a sourcebook that was published by Fordham University . The U.S. Marine Corps is thought to have unofficially adopted the saying during the Vietnam War. However, Snopes was unable to independently verify whether the phrase is associated with the branch. Some social media users argued that Buck's wearing the shirt was in bad taste after months of clashes around the nation between police forces and protesters of racial injustice. Supporters of Buck countered that his wearing of the shirt showed solitary with U.S. military forces. Buck's office did not respond to requests for comment at the time of publication. It is not clear at what event Buck wore the shirt, but a look at the Colorado GOP event calendar for the month of August 2020 revealed party events held in Delta County on Aug. 3, Montrose County on Aug. 13, and Mesa County on Aug. 21. The images were shared once again with Colorado constituents in a Sept. 1 email campaign led on behalf of Ike McCorkle , a Democrat from Colorado who is running for the state's 4th Congressional District — Buck’s seat. A spokesperson with the McCorkle campaign confirmed that the photo was taken by a photographer attending a GOP event and that to the best of his staff’s knowledge, the image was authentic. ""The image captured of Ken Buck was from a ‘Guns and BBQ’ rally held in Grand Junction,"" said Samuel Banick, the communications director for McCorkle's campaign. As for the other two candidates mentioned in the meme, Lauren Boebert , a Republican candidate for Colorado’s 3rd congressional district, has made several references to QAnon , a fringe theory that has been connected to dozens of congressional candidates. In September, U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner , who is also up for reelection, made headlines after he accused public health experts of politicizing the coronavirus pandemic.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,779
5e3e8a64-05d4-485c-ab75-0a385b5c3e1b,"On Aug. 24, 2020, a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was captured on cellphone video shooting Jacob Blake, a Black man, multiple times as he tried to enter his vehicle. Demonstrations against police brutality erupted in Kenosha on Aug. 25, in reaction to Blake's shooting. These protests spiraled into chaos when white, armed agitators appeared on the streets. Some, like teenager Kyle Rittenhouse, were accused of shootings. Memes emerged online comparing law enforcement's treatment of Rittenhouse — who is white — to that of Tamir Rice — a Black boy shot and killed by police in 2014 after his toy gun was mistaken for a real one. Snopes readers shared versions of these posts with us and asked us to look into their accuracy. While the two scenarios are glaringly different, especially in their outcomes, most of the claims aligned with the facts in each case. What Happened to Tamir Rice? On Nov. 22, 2014, 12-year-old Rice was fatally shot by a police officer in Cleveland, Ohio. Rice had been playing in a park and posing with a toy gun that fired plastic pellets, according to The New York Times . Police received a 911 call that day that there was a ""guy in here with a pistol."" But the caller’s complete message that the gun was ""probably fake"" and the person holding the gun was ""probably a juvenile"" was never conveyed to the officer involved in the shooting. Within seconds of arriving at the park, the police officer shot Rice in the abdomen at point-blank range. The officer later said that he warned the boy three times to raise his hands, a claim many have doubted. What Happened to Kyle Rittenhouse? On Aug. 25, 2020, footage showed 17-year-old Rittenhouse firing at protesters with an AR-15-style firearm after being chased in Kenosha. He was not legally old enough to wield an assault rifle in that state. Video footage showed police tossing bottles of water to Rittenhouse and other armed white people, telling them: ""We appreciate you guys."" This occurred shortly before the shootings he was later implicated in. After Rittenhouse allegedly shot three people (two fatally), The New York Times reported that ""police vehicles remained stationary during the gunfire."" Rittenhouse then walked with his hands up towards the police, while bystanders called out to them that he had just shot people. But the police drove by without stopping in order to assist victims. Rittenhouse then drove to his home town of Antioch in Lake County, Illinois, about 20 miles from Kenosha. We can't confirm if Rittenhouse went home to sleep, but according to reports , he was arrested the next day — on Aug. 26 — at his mother's house. He was charged with two counts of reckless intentional homicide and one count of attempted reckless intentional homicide. He was also charged with reckless endangerment and possession of a deadly weapon by a person under the age of 18, according to a criminal complaint . At the time of writing this, Rittenhouse was being held in a juvenile facility in Illinois, while authorities planned to extradite him to Wisconsin. Conclusion While the majority of the statements presented in the meme are accurate, the contexts are very different. We also could not prove what Rittenhouse did when he returned to his home town before getting arrested. We thus rate this claim as ""Mostly True.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,643
06046c55-f2a6-4a6d-87e8-f68195dde7b5,"Although the custom is sometimes more honored in the breach than in the observance, the U.S. Flag Code states that ""During a rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart."" Given how finely-attuned candidates for high office usually are to the importance of symbolism, Illinois senator (and Democratic presidential hopeful) Barack Obama caused something of a stir in September 2007 when he was seemingly spotted not observing the hand-over-heart protocol during a playing of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at an Indianola, Iowa, steak fry attended by the six top Democratic presidential candidates: Boy, that's exactly who we need as President! Does this man not cross his heart when the National Anthem is playing, or when the flag is raised or lowered? OR, was this an accident on his part? Photo shows 4 of them, including the infamous Hillary... Senator Barack Obama, Governor Bill Richardson, Senator Hillary Clinton and Ruth Harkin during the national anthem. Barack Hussein Obama's photo (that's his real name). The article said he REFUSED TO NOT ONLY PUT HIS HAND ON HIS HEART DURING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, BUT REFUSED TO SAY THE PLEDGE. How in the hell can a man like this expect to be our next Commander-in-Chief? The photograph itself is real, one of several images of the Iowa steak fry event published by Time , and shows then-Senator Barack Obama standing with his hands clasped just below his waist, while New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, New York senator Hillary Clinton, and Ruth Harkin (wife of Iowa senator Tom Harkin) stand with their hands held over their hearts. It's difficult to establish context from a single still image, but other accounts (including ABC News video of the event) documented that the picture was as described: (It's not clear from the photograph or the video just what the candidates were looking at. The Flag Code advises that they should be ""standing at attention facing the flag,"" but none of them is facing the flag displayed behind the platform on which they're standing. Presumably another flag was in place off to the right of the platform, since most of the candidates were facing that direction.) As we noted earlier, although the U.S. Flag Code still specifies that those present should stand ""with the right hand over the heart"" during the playing of the U.S. national anthem, that particular form is one that has generally come to be observed less and less consistently among the general public over the decades: Experts on the national anthem say the law seems a bit out of date, given its reference to a man's ""headdress."" Yet it's still cited in several military manuals found on the Web. Modern custom does not require a hand over the heart, said Anne Garside, director of communication for the Maryland Historical Society, home of the original manuscript of The Star-Spangled Banner. ""I think the bottom line is that you show respect with your demeanor,"" she said. ""Whether you put your hand over your heart, hold your hat at shoulder level or waist level, is really in this day and age irrelevant."" As for whether this incident was an ""accident,"" whether Senator Obama habitually declines to perform the hand-over-heart gesture, or whether there's any particular meaning to the (non-)action, an Obama campaign spokesperson responded: ""Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. In no way was he making any sort of statement, and any suggestion to the contrary is ridiculous."" The senator himself said that ""My grandfather taught me when I was two. During the Pledge of Allegiance, you put your hand over your heart. During the national anthem, you sing."" When television's Inside Edition ran a segment on this issue, they included some images (supplied by the Obama campaign) of the senator standing with his hand over his heart during other playings of the national anthem: The text accompanying some versions of the e-mailed photograph claimed that Senator Obama ""refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance."" The activity taking place during the scene in the photograph involved the playing of the U.S. national anthem, not a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. The following video clip shows Barack Obama reciting the Pledge during the opening of U.S. Senate sessions: During the Democratic candidates' debate on 15 January 2008, Senator Obama directly refuted the three primary rumors about him that were then circulating via e-mail: that he is a Muslim, that he was sworn in to Congress on the Quran, and that he refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance: This item saw renewed interest in April 2017, when First Lady Melania Trump seemingly had to nudge her husband, President Donald Trump, to place his hand over his heart during the playing of the national anthem while celebrating the annual White House Easter Egg Roll: A spoof article about Barack Obama's stance on the U.S. national anthem was later circulated via e-mail as a genuine statement the then-senator.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,969
050810ee-16b5-4a36-8eff-90429daa7211,"Shortly after presumptive U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden announced Sen. Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, Snopes readers asked us to verify a number of rumors and claims surrounding the Democratic ticket and their respective campaigns. Among them was the question of whether the URL antifa.com automatically redirects to the official campaign website of Biden and Harris. A quick search by Snopes confirmed this rumor to be based in truth (our initial search from Aug. 12, 2020, is recorded in the video clip shown below). As of that date, the URL redirected internet users to joebiden.com . However, by the next day (Aug. 13), the antifa.com site and its redirect had been removed entirely. Since our initial publication of this story, the antifa.com redirect continued to change, pointing users once again to the official Biden campaign website at some point in late August 2020, according to readers. On Aug. 25, the URL redirected at least some users to a site called It’s Going Down (itsgoingdown.org), which described itself as a “community center for anarchist, anti-fascist, autonomous anti-capitalist and anti-colonial movements.” By Aug. 31, the antifa.com URL once again redirected the majority of users to joebiden.com. There was no apparent link between either of the websites and the Biden campaign. https://media.giphy.com/media/d6FEL2SQxYaC9pxTfG/giphy.gif Snopes contacted the Biden campaign for comment regarding any potential involvement with the redirect but did not hear back at the time of publication. In an Aug. 31 Tweet, Rob Flaherty, digital director for the Biden campaign, denied involvement with the redirect and blamed it on internet trolls. Flaherty also noted that antifa.com was registered to an entity located in Russia, which is partly true. An investigation of internet domain search engine Whoxy confirmed that antifa.com was previously registered through a domain privacy service located in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but a cross-reference with WhoIs , an online domain registry record found that the URL was registered under the privacy service “Namecheap Inc” using “WhoisGuard Protected” with a geolocation in Panama. It appeared that antifa.com was last updated on Jan. 1, 2021, but because the domain used a privacy service to hide its registration data, our team was not able to verify the location of the URL owner. Rumored associations with the political protest movement antifa, short for anti-fascists, have plagued Biden’s campaign. In June 2020, the politician was falsely accused of having called the far-left network a “courageous group of Americans.” According to the Anti-Defamation League , antifa is not a unified group but rather a “loose collection of local/regional groups and individuals” that many civil rights organizations have deemed “dangerous and counterproductive” for their use or endorsement of intimidation and violence. As of the most recent update of this article, it is unknown who implemented the web redirect. Anyone who owns or has access to a domain can establish either a temporary or permanent URL redirect, which essentially tells a search engine that the page has moved. As such, a redirect simply directs site visitors to a different URL when they click a particular link, according to website hosting platform Squarespace . According to Whois , antifa.com was registered on April 24, 2002, and was last updated on Oct. 23, 2019. We dug through the internet archives to establish a timeline of the domain in order to determine when the redirect was created. Here’s what we found: The earliest archive of the URL listed the domain as for sale on Nov. 21, 2008 . The domain remained available for sale until Jan. 30, 2020 , according to our analysis of the archives. The first archived version of the URL that directly associates it to the antifa political group is dated May 31, 2020 . On July 23, 2020 , the most recent version of the ""antifa” website was available with a note that an updated website would be coming soon. An Aug. 12, 2020, archived version of antifa.com confirmed that a redirect from antifa.com had been established to send users to the joebiden.com official campaign website (see below). At this time, the URL redirected internet users to joebiden.com. Later on Aug. 12, antifa.com showed a “500 — Internal Server Error” message. At that time, the website was listed as unavailable .

In a viral video posted to the social media platform TikTok in August 2020, user Christian Grech stated that the brand of hand sanitizer he held in the video had been recalled because it contained the dangerous chemical methanol. The video racked up hundreds of thousands of views not long after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had cautioned that a large and growing list of hand sanitizer brands were toxic. It's true that Born Basic Anti-Bac hand sanitizer products that were manufactured by Real Clean Distribuciones SA de CV in Mexico were recalled in 2020 by Born Basic. The product is on the FDA's searchable list of hand sanitizers that are either contaminated or potentially contaminated. The bottles of Born Basic Anti-Bac Hand Sanitizer 70% alcohol that were manufactured at the facility in Mexico were found to contain methanol. On Aug. 13, 2020, the Born Basic brand published a press release detailing that steps have been taken by the company to remediate the issue: The company’s CEO wants to ensure that consumer knows that only the Born Basic sanitizer manufactured in the Real Clean Mexican facility with lot numbers identified on the FDA’s list was impacted. All impacted lots have been removed from market. Aside from issuing a voluntary recall on the affected products, the company halted production at the affected manufacturing facility in Mexico, hired a crisis management company to issue refunds to customers who bought recalled products, and reached out by email and social media to inform the public. A spokesperson for Born Basic said in an Aug. 16, 2020, email that hand sanitizer products currently on store shelves are safe. According to the FDA , ""Substantial methanol exposure could result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death."" Starting in June 2020, amid a buying frenzy of the products during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA warned the public to avoid a growing list of hand sanitizers that were contaminated with methanol. As The Associated Press reported in July 2020, ""The active ingredient that kills germs in legitimate sanitizers is ethyl alcohol, which is consumable. But some Mexican companies have been replacing it with poisonous methanol, or wood alcohol, which is used in antifreeze."" In a statement released July 2, 2020, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said : All Americans should practice good hand hygiene, which includes using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Unfortunately, there are some companies taking advantage of the increased usage of hand sanitizer during the coronavirus pandemic and putting lives at risk by selling products with dangerous and unacceptable ingredients. Consumers and health care providers should not use methanol-containing hand sanitizers. The list of hand sanitizer brands the FDA is warning against has ballooned to more than 130 brands. Members of the public can search the FDA's database to see if the brand they own is on the list.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,637
2e3d5793-897a-46a0-aac5-907f0553903b,"Rumors are surging in the wake of George Floyd's death and resulting protests against police violence and racial injustice in the United States. Stay informed. Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here . Viral videos showing what appeared to be protesters in Portland, Oregon, burning American flags and Bibles made waves over the first weekend of August 2020, following more than two straight months of protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd , a Black man who died in Minneapolis in May 2020 while in police custody. Snopes readers asked us to investigate whether these allegations were factual. After speaking to an eyewitness and police, we conclude that the claim about Portland protesters is true. Tweets shared by Danny Peterson , a reporter with CBS station KOIN 6 , showed several videos and photos of protesters burning American flags and open books that resemble the Bible, as well as several other items, including newspapers and a pizza box. Although videos show items being tossed into a fire and burned, it was not obvious which protest group was affiliated with those actions and whether the books being burned were, in fact, Bibles. Snopes spoke with Peterson, who said that he had seen a truck handing out free Bibles earlier in the day and confirmed with protesters that the book he saw burning was a Bible. The videos were captured outside the Mark O. Hatfield U. S. Federal Courthouse, the epicenter of a months-long clash between federal agents and Black Lives Matter protesters. Peterson described the fires as having happened organically and began after most of the peaceful protesters had left the area. Conservative publications and social media users laid blame on “anarchists,” the “radical left,” and Black Lives Matter protesters for allegedly burning the flags and Bibles, but officials did not confirm which group the culprits were affiliated with. The groups burning Bibles and American flags did not self-identify with any particular group, Peterson told us. ""Many of these protests have been a non-homogeneous mixture of people with greatly varying political ideologies, and this night was no exception, from what I could tell,"" he said. According to his accounts, there wasn't ""much violence in the area,"" but the burning of Bibles and American flags seemed intentional and appeared to be a political expression of some sort and were not just ""coincidental objects that people burned in order to make a fire."" Weekend protests began the night of July 31 and were largely peaceful before escalating the following morning, according to a statement released by the Portland Police Bureau (PPB). The agency noted that protesters ""lit fires, climbed the fence outside the federal courthouse, threw objects and chanted.” The statement read, ""On August 1, 2020, at about 1:30 a.m. people started a bonfire in the middle of Southwest 3rd Avenue in front of the federal courthouse. People brought plywood and other flammable material to keep it going. Over the next hour, the number of people dwindled to a few dozen.” In an email to Snopes, PPB Sgt. Kevin Allen wrote that he was unable to confirm whether Bibles and flags were among the items burned, and that the fires were not considered an immediate threat. In the interest of de-escalation, police did not interact with the crowd. The fire was reportedly put out by members of Moms United for Black Lives Matter, and the crowd had largely dispersed by 2:30 a.m. on Aug. 2. A video clip of the Portland Bible burning circulated by the Kremlin-backed news agency Ruptly appeared to be among the first viral Russian disinformation campaigns in advance of the 2020 presidential election, according to an Aug. 10 report by The New York Times . The publication likened this form of “information laundering” to money laundering in which Russian news outlets elaborate upon a “kernel of truth” to spin the event into larger, more polarizing issues that exacerbate already tense issues to further separate American voters and political parties.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,753

From April 10, 2020, to June 27, 2020, 13 sisters from the same convent in Michigan died from COVID-19, prompting Snopes readers to ask if that particularly concentrated pandemic tragedy was true. Sadly, it is true. Twelve sisters from Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Convent in Livonia, Michigan, died within 30 days of each other during an outbreak of the coronavirus disease between April 10 and May 10. Another sister died on June 27. Suzanne English, executive director of mission advancement for the Felician Sisters of North America — the congregation that the sisters belonged to — told us in a statement that although not all 13 sisters were tested, their symptoms were ""inline with COVID"" amid the outbreak at the convent. In the case of the final fatality on June 27, English said, ""the Sister had been COVID-positive and while she had passed the 28-day quarantine, we believe it was the lingering effects that caused her death."" Although some news reports referred to the women as ""nuns,"" English pointed out that because the Felicians are monastic (living under religious vows), they are correctly referred to as ""sisters."" A total of 30 sisters at the Livonia convent — of the 57 then living there — were infected. Seventeen recovered, English said in an email, citing Sister Noel Marie Gabriel, director of clinical health services for the Felicians. According to Global Sisters Report, a news publication focusing on Catholic sisters and current events, the 13 sisters who passed were heavily involved in their community, performing services like working as nurses, educators, and librarians. ""That was our most tragic time,"" Sister Gabriel told the publication. ""It was a month of tragedy and sorrow and mourning and grieving."" Officially known as the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Felix of Cantalice, the convent in Livonia is one of 60 Felician convents in North America.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,451

Snopes readers asked us to look into one such gathering on the Fourth of July, when a group of heavily armed Black militia members allegedly marched on a Confederate monument in Georgia’s Stone Mountain Park: News reports and statements from park officials confirm that this rally did indeed take place, though social media posts such as the above misrepresented significant details of the event. Around 1,000 predominantly Black militia members, wearing paramilitary-style clothing and wielding rifles, gathered at the Stone Mountain sculpture of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and military leaders Robert E. Lee and Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. White nationalist rallies have taken place there in the past, and the monument has historical ties to the Ku Klux Klan. The group behind the march, known as the Not Fucking Around Coalition (they have no known affiliation with the Black Panther Party, contrary to what is stated in the tweet above), identifies as an all-Black militia, and said they were also not connected to the Black Lives Matter movement. Speakers at the rally challenged white supremacists to face them, and called for the monument's removal. While the majority of attendees were Black, Reuters reported that individuals of other ethnicities were also spotted in the crowd. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZgH-x_UWcw&feature=emb_title The group also had a police escort , and the march was peaceful. John Bankhead, a spokesperson for the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, the organization that operates the park, said: It's a public park, state park. We have these protests on both sides of the issue from time to time. We respect people's First Amendment right to exercise those rights. We understand the sensitivity of the issues here at the park and the dark past so we respect that and allow them to come in. As long as it's peaceful, which it has been, then that's fine. Snopes reached out to the park's association for more information, and will update this article if we hear back. Given the ample media coverage, footage of the Black militia, and statements from park officials confirming that such a march did take place, we rate this claim as “True.”",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,455

It's true that Lowe's has created a $25 million grant for minority-owned small businesses trying to reopen after being forced to close due to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. As CNBC reported on May 20, 2020: Lowe’s is dishing out the funds to help small businesses, especially home improvement professionals, in need of masks, personal protective equipment and other supplies to operate safely. The new funds follow $340 million of support the home improvement retailer provided for Covid-19 response activities in the first quarter. “These are going to be minority businesses and other businesses that are now starting to reopen,” CEO Marvin Ellison told CNBC’s Jim Cramer in a “Mad Money” interview. “So we just want to continue to not only run a good business but also be a great corporate citizen in all of the communities that we operate in.” It is also true that Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus donated $7 million to U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. He vowed to again support Trump in his 2020 run against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Marcus, a philanthropist who gives billions of dollars away to various causes, is generally a large-ticket financial supporter of Republican politicians and organizations. But he also retired from his position as Home Depot's company chairman in 2002. (Home Depot's other co-founder, Arthur Blank, who is also retired from the company, appears to donate primarily to Democrats.) The Home Depot political action committee on the other hand has contributed a total of $1,495,000 to both Democratic and Republican federal candidates in 2020, with 44% of those contributions going to Democrats and 56% to Republicans, according to the campaign transparency tracking tool Open Secrets. Meantime the political action committee for Lowe's donated a total of $540,500 to federal candidates in both parties, with 30% going to Democrats and 70% to Republicans, per Open Secrets. Political action committees (PACs) associated with corporations are separate organizations that are funded by employees or owners of the company (but not the company itself). These PACs donate money to political candidates and organizations they believe to be ""aligned with their financial goals,"" explains Open Secrets.

38802d7b-3636-47c4-8813-a85f647daa90,"On June 3, 2020, a video supposedly showing two segments from Laura Ingraham's Fox News show ""The Ingraham Angle"" dealing with athletes expressing their political opinions started to circulate on social media. Both of the clips featured in this video are genuine. The first segment aired on Ingraham's show in February 2018 and shows the Fox News host telling NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Durant, both black men, to ""shut up and dribble"" after they criticized U.S. President Donald Trump and spoke out about racism in the United States. Ingraham said at the time : Must they run their mouths like that? Unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take these ignorant comments seriously. Look, there might be a cautionary lesson in LeBron for kids: This is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA. And it's always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid $100 million a year to bounce a ball. Oh, and LeBron and Kevin? You're great players but no one voted for you. Millions elected Trump to be their coach. So keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, shut up and dribble. Here's a longer version of the clip: The second clip comes from June 3, 2020, and shows Ingraham defending Drew Brees after the NFL star, a white man, said that he would ""never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag"" when he was asked about football players kneeling during the National Anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice. Ingraham said: Well he's allowed to have his view of what kneeling and the flag means to him. I mean, he's a person. He has some worth, I would imagine. This is beyond football though. This is totalitarian conduct. This is Stalinist. And by the way on the streets of New Orleans they are shouting 'F Drew Brees.' That's what this moment has done to the beautiful team spirit of the New Orleans Saints... He's giving $5 million to charity by the way. A longer clip of this segment is viewable at The Daily Beast . While Ingraham defended Brees' remarks, the NFL player later apologized to his teammates, his fans, and the people of New Orleans, writing: ""I would like to apologize to my friends, teammates, the City of New Orleans, the black community, NFL community and anyone I hurt with my comments yesterday. In speaking with some of you, it breaks my heart to know the pain I have caused. In an attempt to talk about respect, unity, and solidarity centered around the American flag and the national anthem, I made comments that were insensitive and completely missed the mark on the issues we are facing right now as a country."" Ingraham addressed the controversy stemming from comparisons of her comments on Brees and James in a follow-up segment on June 5, in which she noted a ""nuance between the two instances"" and said, ""Every American, every American has the God-given right to speak his mind on any issue.""

In early March 2020, amid the COVID-19 coronavirus disease outbreak that would later grow into a pandemic, the massive retail and delivery company Amazon launched the Amazon Relief Fund, which among other things, offers grants to contract and seasonal workers so they can receive sick pay if they contract the coronavirus. The $25 million fund established by Amazon sparked an online backlash after a liberal newsletter pointed out that seasonal and contract workers would have to file an application to receive the funds, and that Amazon, a behemoth corporation whose founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is the richest person in the world, solicited public donations for the program. Anger over the idea that a famously profitable corporation was soliciting donations from the public to fund sick leave for some of its workforce during a pandemic was initiated by reporting from Popular Information, described as a ""newsletter about politics and power."" The letter's founder, Judd Legum, posted this Twitter thread on March 24, 2020: We reached out to Amazon for comment and received the following statement: We are not and have not asked for donations and the Amazon Relief Fund has been funded by Amazon with an initial donation of $25 million. The structure to operate a fund like this, which hundreds of companies do through the same third-party, requires the program to be open to public contributions but we are not soliciting those contributions in any way. Amazon truly did launch a $25 million fund to provide sick leave for contract workers and seasonal employees through a grant program to which those workers must file applications before receiving benefits. Although the wording on the page has since been updated to indicate that donations are not expected, initially the language did indicate that Amazon was seeking — or at the very least suggesting — donations. An archived version of the page from March 19, 2020, included this statement (shown in the screen capture below): ""The Fund relies primarily on individual donations from individuals and support from Amazon.com Services LLC to fund this program."" The page has since been updated . The highlighted sentence above was removed and the page now explicitly states that donations from the public are not expected, as follows: We reached out to Legum, who told us via email that he believed Amazon changed the wording on the relief fund page ""because the optics were clearly bad and the company is trying to cover up its actions."" Legum added that in his view, ""Amazon has ample resources to simply pay their contractors while they are out sick during this pandemic."" According to Amazon's announcement , the Amazon Relief Fund will provide their delivery partners and drivers ""the ability to apply for grants approximately equal to up to two-weeks of pay if diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine by the government or Amazon."" Additionally, the statement reads, ""this fund will support our employees and contractors around the world who face financial hardships from other qualifying events, such as a natural disaster, federally declared emergency, or unforeseen personal hardship. Applicants can apply and receive a personal grant from the fund ranging from $400 to $5,000 USD per person."" The company also announced it is offering unlimited unpaid time off for hourly staff during the month of March. Whether or not Amazon actively solicited donations, the original wording on its Amazon Relief Fund page did call for individuals to donate to the fund. Even though the wording has been updated to state explicitly that no donations from the public are expected, a ""Donate"" button still exists on the page, which could be interpreted as an invitation to do so. We therefore rate this claim ""True.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,775
9e63c460-0674-4f1b-99eb-ad5e85c17ad3,"In March 2020, shortly after Democratic candidates Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren all announced that they were dropping out of the U.S. presidential race, a message started to circulate on social media which claimed that the three previous presidents, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, would all be the youngest candidates in the 2020 presidential race if they were to, hypothetically, jump into the contest: This tweet is largely accurate. Obama, Clinton, and Bush are all younger than President Donald Trump, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Bernie Sanders. However, as of this writing, there is one other person in this race: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who is the youngest candidate in the field by far at just 38 years old. (Gabbard, however, is long shot for president as she has only secured a single delegate, compared to the 500+ already won by Sanders and Biden each.) Other than Gabbard, the youngest candidate in the 2020 presidential race is Trump , who was born on June 14, 1946, and is currently 73 years old. Biden would be the next youngest candidate at age 77 (he was born on Nov. 20, 1942), while Sanders is the oldest at age 78 (he was born Sept. 8, 1941). Ages of the current 2020 presidential field: Sanders is 78. Biden is 77. Trump is 73. Gabbard is 38. Obama, Bush, and Clinton are all constitutionally prohibited from running for a third term as president. Hypothetically speaking, however, if they did enter the race they would all be younger than the current field of candidates, excluding Gabbard. Bush is the oldest of these three and is only younger than Trump by a month. Bush was born on July 6, 1946, and is currently 73 years old. Clinton , too, is also 73 but he's a few months younger than both Bush and Trump. Clinton was born on Aug. 19, 1946. Obama is the youngest on this list at 58 years old (he was born Aug. 4, 1961). Ages of the previous three presidents: Bush is 73. Clinton is 73. Obama is 58. Who is the oldest president in U.S. history? When Trump took office in January 2017, he became the oldest person in the history of the United States to win a presidential election at age 70. The previous person to hold this title was Ronald Reagan, who was approaching his 70th birthday when he took office in 1981. While Trump is the oldest person to win a presidential election, he isn't the oldest person to serve as president. Reagan still holds that title, as he left office at the age of 77. If Trump wins reelection and serves out his full four-year term, he will surpass Reagan as the oldest president in history. Sanders and Biden would both start their terms as president as the oldest people to win elections and the oldest people to serve. Biden would be 78 when he takes office, and Sanders would be 79. As of this writing, we've never had an octogenarian as president of the United States. Who is the youngest president in U.S. history? While the 2020 presidential election will likely be won by somebody in their seventies, the U.S. has been led by some relatively young chief executives. Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest person to hold the office when he succeeded William McKinley at age 42 after the latter was assassinated in 1901. John F. Kennedy was 43 when he took office in 1961. Clinton and Obama are both among the top five of youngest presidential candidates (3rd and 5th), taking office at ages 46 and 47, respectively. The fourth youngest was Ulysses S. Grant who took office at age 46 in 1869. If Gabbard wins the 2020 election, she would become the youngest president in history, taking office before her 40th birthday.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,749

Amid warnings from public health officials that a 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus could soon become a pandemic involving the U.S., alarmed readers asked Snopes to verify a rumor that U.S. President Donald Trump had ""fired the entire pandemic response team two years ago and then didn't replace them."" The claim came from a series of tweets posted by Judd Legum, who runs Popular Information, a newsletter he describes as being about ""politics and power."" Legum's commentary was representative of sharp criticism from Democratic legislators (and some Republicans) that the Trump administration had ill-prepared the country for a pandemic even as one was looming on the horizon. Legum outlined a series of cost-cutting decisions made by the Trump administration in preceding years that had gutted the nation's infectious disease defense infrastructure. The ""pandemic response team"" firing claim referred to news accounts from Spring 2018 reporting that White House officials tasked with directing a national response to a pandemic had been ousted. Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer abruptly departed from his post leading the global health security team on the National Security Council in May 2018 amid a reorganization of the council by then-National Security Advisor John Bolton, and Ziemer's team was disbanded. Tom Bossert, whom the Washington Post reported ""had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks,"" had been fired one month prior. It's thus true that the Trump administration axed the executive branch team responsible for coordinating a response to a pandemic and did not replace it, eliminating Ziemer's position and reassigning others, although Bolton was the executive at the top of the National Security Council chain of command at the time. Legum stated in a follow-up tweet that ""Trump also cut funding for the CDC, forcing the CDC to cancel its efforts to help countries prevent infectious-disease threats from becoming epidemics in 39 of 49 countries in 2018. Among the countries abandoned? China."" That was partly true, according to 2018 news reports stating that funding for the CDC’s global disease outbreak prevention efforts had been reduced by 80%, including funding for the agency’s efforts in China. But that was the result of the anticipated depletion of previously allotted funding, not a direct cut by the Trump administration. And as the CDC told FactCheck.org , the cuts were ultimately avoided because Congress provided other funding. On Feb. 24, 2020, the Trump administration requested $2.5 billion to address the coronavirus outbreak, an outlay critics asserted might not have been necessary if the previous program cuts had not taken place. Fortune reported of the issue that: The cuts could be especially problematic as COVID-19 continues to spread. Health officials are now warning the U.S. is unlikely to be spared, even though cases are minimal here so far. ""It's not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a press call [on Feb. 25]. The coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China, in the winter of 2019, and cases spread around the globe. The U.S. had 57 confirmed cases as of this writing, while globally, roughly 80,000 patients had been sickened with the virus and 3,000 had died. As of yet , no vaccine or pharmaceutical treatment for the new coronavirus.

But his reasoning for doing so appeared to contradict his public commentary on the strength of the economy, prompting several Snopes readers to ask if the proposal was real. It was. In the message , Trump stated that federal law ""authorizes me to implement alternative plans for pay adjustments for civilian Federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay systems if, because of 'national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare,' I view the increases that would otherwise take effect as inappropriate."" Congress approved a 3.1% raise for federal workers, which went into effect in 2020. It was the largest pay increase in a decade. Legislation introduced for 2021 calls for for a 3.5% increase. Trump on the other hand proposed a 1% raise that will go into effect unless Congress approves an alternate amount, confirmed Tim Kauffman, spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest employee union representing federal workers. It's not unusual for presidents to make efforts to prevent full pay raises for federal workers from going into effect, Kauffman said. What is unusual is that Trump is using the economy to justify cuts even as he has been outspoken about the strength of the economy. One day after his message to Congress, Trump tweeted , ""BEST USA ECONOMY IN HISTORY!"" We sent a question to the White House Press Office asking for an explanation for the seeming contradiction but got no answer. ""If the economy is doing so well, then why can’t we afford to provide a pay raise to the federal workers, a third of whom are veterans, who ensure our democracy is working every day and ensure services are delivered,"" Kauffman said. ""Currently federal employees make about 4% less today than they did at the start of the decade, counting for inflation."" Federal employee raises fall under the purview of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990, a law that is intended to ensure that government worker compensation is on par with the salaries of their peers in the private sector. But ""every single president except maybe the first year [the law was in effect] under [George H.W. Bush], they have used national economic concerns to prevent the full raise from taking effect,"" Kauffman said.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,466
41cf6a36-c5bb-4780-8b43-eff0dc2528ad,"In February 2020 readers asked us about an opinion column written by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, which claimed that a new bill proposed by U.S. House Democrats would, if passed in its current form, protect immigrants from deportation even if they commit crimes. The op-ed , published on Feb. 7, bore the headline ""Criminals Would Be Protected From Deportation Under Bill AOC and Other House Democrats Back."" The piece included the following: Under current U.S. law, legal U.S. immigrants can be deported if they commit an “aggravated felony” or a “crime of moral turpitude” – that is, a vile, depraved act, like molesting a child. Under the New Way Forward Act, “crimes of moral turpitude” are eliminated entirely as a justification for deportation. And the category of “aggravated felony” gets circumscribed too. What does that mean? Consider this: Under current law, immigrants who commit serious crimes – such as robbery, fraud, or child sexual abuse – must be deported, regardless of the sentence they receive. Other crimes – less severe ones like racketeering – require deportation as long as the perpetrator receives at least a one-year sentence. But if this bill passes the House and Senate and is signed into law by the president, there will no longer be any crimes that automatically require deportation. None. And one crime – falsifying a passport – will be made immune from deportation, no matter what. Because apparently 9/11 never happened, and we no longer care about fake government documents ... Under the proposed legislation, the minimum prison sentence for crimes that still require deportation would rise from one year to five... The bill would grant sweeping new powers to immigration judges, allowing them to nullify a deportation order. Carlson's op-ed, and a subsequent segment on his Fox News show, featured numerous specific claims about the legislation, but the one that drew the most inquiries from Snopes readers was the same one Fox News included in its headline — that the New Way Forward Act would ""protect criminals from deportation."" As a result, that claim is the focus of this particular fact check. What the bill proposes If it were signed into law and implemented, the New Way Forward Act would bring about a number of changes to U.S. federal law on deportations. The following is a summary of those changes, as found in the version of the legislation published in December 2019 (the most up-to-date version at the time of Carlson's article and at the time of this fact check): Removes crimes of moral turpitude and crimes carrying a sentence of at least one year as a grounds for deportation (deportable offenses) Removes drug crimes, drug abuse and drug addiction as deportable offenses Stipulates that ""aggravated felonies"" such as murder, rape, child sexual abuse and drug trafficking must have carried a sentence of at least five years in order to qualify as deportable offenses Redefines an aggravated felony -- which includes theft, racketeering, bribery, obstruction of justice and certain crimes of violence -- so that only offenses which carry a sentence of at least five years would be labelled as aggravated felonies and thereby liable to form the basis of a deportation order Removes the forging of a passport as a deportable offense Changes the definition of ""conviction"" to exclude cases where a criminal conviction has been overturned, expunged, vacated, and so on, cases where only probation has been ordered, and cases where a judgement of guilt is currently under appeal. Stipulates that the sentence imposed in a given conviction can only be regarded as including the period of the sentence to be served, and cannot include suspended portions of sentences Stipulates that only an aggravated felony that came with a sentence of at least five years can be treated as a ""particularly serious crime,"" thereby entitling the U.S. Attorney General to reject any asylum application filed by the offender in question. Another section of the New Way Forward Act would give immigration judges significant new discretionary powers in deciding whether to issue a deportation order. Under existing law , judges are only allowed to consider ""the evidence produced at the hearing,"" before making their determination. Under the proposed legislation, judges would be able to weigh that evidence, including the existence of prior deportable offenses, against other factors. This means that even if an immigrant has been convicted of a deportable criminal offense, an immigration judge could, under the bill, decline to order their deportation ""in pursuit of humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest.” Analysis Clearly, the provisions of the New Way Forward Act would make it more difficult to deport immigrants who have committed certain crimes, most notably the removal of lower-level drug crimes as a deportable offense, and the proposed requirement that aggravated felonies be redefined as carrying at least a five-year prison sentence in order to form the basis of a deportation order. Giving immigration judges the ability to exercise discretion and decline to order a deportation for humanitarian reasons is also likely to lower the deportation rate by a certain degree, though it should be noted that the legislation would not impose any legal requirement on judges to be more lenient in their decisions. The headline of the article -- ""Criminals Would Be Protected From Deportation Under Bill AOC and Other House Democrats Back"" -- risked giving some readers the mistaken impression that the New Way Forward Act would entirely protect immigrants who have violated U.S. criminal law from being deported. That would not be the case -- such offenders could and undoubtedly would continue to be deported under the proposed legislation. Rather, the bill would mean certain offenses could no longer form the sole basis of a deportation order, and the sentencing threshold for ""aggravated felonies"" would be increased from one year to five years, thereby enhancing the protections against deportation available to immigrants who were convicted of such crimes and sentenced to between one and five years in prison. The body of Carlson's article outlined those facts with greater nuance than the headline did.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1135

Rumors circulated that Garrett would be fired from his post with the NFL team after a subpar performance in 2019 and in spite of a win over the Washington Redskins on Dec. 29,  prompting readers to ask Snopes.com to verify. The sports news site ESPN reported that Garrett was set to meet on Dec. 31 with team owner Jerry Jones and Jones' son, Stephen, who is the Cowboys' executive vice president. On Jan. 5, 2020, the team made it official with an article on the Dallas Cowboys website reporting that the team opted to part ways with Garrett: Team owner/general manager Jerry Jones confirmed the news in an official statement. “We are extremely grateful to Jason Garrett for his more than 20 years of service to the Dallas Cowboys as a player, assistant coach and head coach,” Jones said. “His level of commitment, character and dedication to this organization has been outstanding at every stage of his career.” The news gives some clarity to a story that has gotten quite confusing since the Cowboys were eliminated from the postseason last weekend.

The former Prez and First Lady have been renting the house this summer and loved it so much, we've learned they made an offer. The property is listed at $14,850,000. Our sources say they're paying less, but we don't know how much. The details of the potential sale were not made public at the time and, as TMZ reported, “it's not a done deal just yet. We're told there are contingencies so it's possible it could fall apart.” The property in question in the affluent Massachusetts community was listed at just shy of $15 million and does have waterfront access. As of Sept. 6, 2019, no sales report of the purchase had been logged with the Dukes County Registry of Deeds. We reached out to the Obama family press office to inquire about the status of the transaction but have not received a response. All major reporting on the topic, at that point, stemmed from TMZ’s ""multiple island sources."" Neither the realtors nor representatives for Grousbeck provided statements to the news media. In December 2019, the Martha's Vineyard Gazette reported that the sale had been completed and that the new deedholder is a nominee trust representing the Obamas: Former President Obama and his family are now permanent homeowners on Martha’s Vineyard, after completing the purchase this week of a large home situated on nearly 30 acres in the coastal perimeter of Edgartown. The purchase price, recorded at 3:31 p.m. Wednesday with the Dukes County Registry of Deeds, is listed at $11.75 million. The buyer is a nominee trust representing the former First Family. The sellers are Wycliffe Grousbeck and Corinne Basler Grousbeck. Mr. Grousbeck is a private equity investor and owner of the Boston Celtics basketball team. The deed lists the buyer as ""James F. Reynolds, as trustee of The 79 Turkeyland Cove Road Nominee Trust."" Multiple news reports have identified Reynolds as a longtime friend of the former first family, but none of the documents available through the Dukes Country Registry of Deeds mentioned the Obamas by name at the time.

8a13e94c-3cdc-489f-9634-406ca726bc89,"A frequent political talking point — when issues of tax law and corporate governance are concerned — is the lack of income taxes Amazon pays to the federal government. In 2018, Snopes rated “True” the claim that the online retailer had paid no such taxes in the 2017 tax year. Readers raised the same question for the 2018 tax year, and once again our rating is ""True."" Though Amazon’s actual U.S. tax filings are not public, a broad overview of their overall tax burden can be found in their SEC 10-K filing. In 2018, the company made over $200 billion in sales, but paid no money to the U.S. government in the form of income tax (in fact, the government actually owed the company some $129 million as noted in parentheses in the chart below): However, the company did pay taxes abroad and at the state level: ""Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate, including paying $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Yahoo Finance in February 2019. As we discussed in our previous Amazon tax fact check, the methods employed to make that extremely reduced tax burden a reality are only vaguely described by the company, but the process involves taking as many tax credits as possible under the law. ""We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income,"" the company wrote in their SEC filing . Stock-based compensation refers to the fact that publicly traded corporations, like Amazon, can list the stock options they grant to employees as a business cost in their accounting, and if an option-receiving employee makes over $1 million a year in salary, the profits from the sale of those stocks can then be counted as a federal income tax deduction for the corporation. With respect to the other tax credits or deductions? ""It’s hard to know exactly what they’re doing,"" Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy for the non-partisan Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, told Yahoo. ""Their public documents ... don’t lay out their tax strategy. So it’s unclear exactly which breaks [Amazon is taking advantage of].""

2b91175b-9850-4c1d-ae38-14a86b8c5853,"In December 2018, social media users shared a story on the self-publishing site auxx.me bearing the headline, ""Drone Footage Reveals Over 100 Whales Trapped in Secret Underwater 'Jails,'"" with many questioning whether the report was real. Aside from the fact that the cages are hardly ""secret,"" the story is sadly true. The information was originally reported by the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta on 30 October 2018. The paper revealed that more than 100 whales were caged in small enclosures off Russia's Pacific coast near the city of Nakhodka, possibly in violation of an international ban on commercial whale hunting. The account has since been picked up by reputable English-language news outlets including CBS News and the UK's Telegraph . According to news reports, 90 belugas and 11 orcas are being held in small enclosures that reporters have dubbed ""whale jails"" or ""whale prison."" Some of the animals have been held there since July 2018 and many suspect they will be sold for entertainment in a burgeoning marine park industry in China, as The Telegraph reported: ""An Orca whale can reportedly fetch more than $6 million in the booming ocean theme park industry in neighbouring China. There are more than 60 marine parks in China, and at least a dozen more are under construction."" Although Russian prosecutors are investigating the capture and export of the animals by four companies, identified by Novaya Gazeta as LLC Oceanarium DV, LLC Afalina, LLC Bely Kit and LLC Sochi Dolphinarium, the fate of the animals is currently unclear. Thomas Henningsen, a marine biologist who is head of the Russia program for the international environmental activist organization Greenpeace, confirmed to us via email that as of 19 December 2018 the whales were still in the cages and that the conditions there were ""disastrous and cruel."" Experts cited by The Telegraph also opined that many of the whales were likely infants, based on the sheer number of them packed into pens -- ""even though the capture of whale calves is categorically forbidden."" News reports included an apparent cell phone video that captured the moment one of the whales was lifted by crane and placed into a tank for transport: Drone footage posted to social media by the Russian government-controlled news outlet RT also stoked public anger, showing whales crowded into small pens: ‘Whale prison’ discovered by drone in Far East Russia pic.twitter.com/gkZBVmYwVp — RT (@RT_com) November 8, 2018 According to the animal-oriented web site The Dodo, the process for capturing the whales is harrowing and potentially deadly due to the stress and exhaustion the animals endure: “The capture operators are apparently using ‘purse seining,’” Naomi Rose, a marine mammal scientist at the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI), told The Dodo. “They encircle a group of spooked whales with small chase boats. One of these boats drops a net into the water when the whales are huddled together and draws it around the group. The bottom of the net has a line attached and is pulled closed. This is ‘pursing’ — turning the net into a big bag, basically, with the whales inside.” Once the animals are caught, the operators will pick and choose which animals they want to keep. They’re particularly interested in juveniles between 3 and 4 years old, Rose explained. “They then pull the top of the net tighter and tighter until they have corralled off the whale they want … wrestle it onboard with the net or a stretcher, and release the rest,” Rose said. “Sometimes animals get entangled in the net and drown. Or they may exhaust themselves trying to ram through the net and suffer from capture myopathy, a condition that is essentially being exhausted to death — their hearts can simply stop beating.” “The trauma and distress these animals experience during captures is not opinion or emotion — it is fact,” Rose added. “They suffer intense stress-related reactions and their mortality risk spikes sharply soon after capture and then again after transport — they don’t get accustomed to the process. The decimated pods may experience similar stress and trauma — their offspring are being taken from them.” The whales' situation has caused something of an international outcry. Thousands of people have signed a petition demanding the release of the whales. Orcas are renowned for their intelligence, capacity to feel grief, and complex social and family relationships, and their well-being has been a point of evolving controversy . With many local populations endangered or threatened in the wild, the 2013 documentary Blackfish stoked a national backlash in the United States against marine parks such as Sea World for the treatment of captive animals. The matter has reached the highest office in Russia. On 19 December 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state-operated news agency RIA Novosti that Putin was leaning on the local governor in an effort to resolve the issue. In late April 2019, the Russian government enlisted the help of French ocean explorer Jacques-Michel Cousteau of the Ocean Futures Society to help figure out how to safely release the animals in the summer. Criminal charges have been levied against the four companies that have held the whales captive. Reuters reported that as of June 2019, eight of the ten whales, two orcas and six belogas, had been released. However wildlife activists criticized the Russian government for lack of transparency and rushing the process, thus placing the animals at risk. In November 2019, Reuters reported that the release of the remaining whales had been completed, according to a statement from the Russian Research Institute for Fisheries and Oceanology.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1053
847459fe-f7a9-43a9-9c1c-7a03268813b8,"In November 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about news reports that claimed U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened to withdraw federal aid to combat and prevent wildfires in California after he went out of his way to offer his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin some U.S. assistance in fighting wildfires in Siberia. On Nov. 5, Newsweek published an article with the headline, ""Russia Says Trump Once Offered to Help Putin Fight Wildfires -- Now He's Threatening to Withdraw Aid to California."" The article reported that: President Donald Trump seems more willing to help Russia fight wildfires than California, considering he just threatened to cut off federal aid to the state months after offering to aid Russia in battling blazes in parts of Siberia. On Sunday, Trump slammed California Governor Gavin Newsom for his handling of the wildfires and vaguely warned that he would end the federal funding. Newsom declared a statewide emergency last week in an effort to mobilize resources. ""Every year, as the fire's rage & California burns, it is the same thing—and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor. You don't see close to the level of burn in other states,"" Trump wrote on Twitter... The president's remarks about California's governor come after he offered last summer to help Russia fight a similar battle against wildfires. According to the Kremlin, Trump made the offer to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a phone call in early August. At the time, the wildfires were so large that Greenpeace Russia said they were creating an ""ecological catastrophe."" Putin reportedly expressed his ""sincere gratitude"" to Trump for the offer and said that if necessary he would take him up on it. What Trump said about California Trump has a history of publicly criticizing officials in California (in particular Democrats such as Gov. Gavin Newsom) and attributing wildfires in the state to purportedly bad ""forest management."" He has repeatedly threatened to withdraw federal emergency assistance for the state, including in November 2018, when he tweeted ""Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more [federal] payments!"" There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018 Two months later, he declared on Twitter: ""Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!"" Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2019 On Nov. 3, as the 2019 California wildfire season developed, Trump criticized Newsom in a series of tweets that read: ""The Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, has done a terrible job of forest management. I told him from the first day we met that he must 'clean' his forest floors regardless of what his bosses, the environmentalists, DEMAND of him. Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers...Every year, as the fire’s [sic] rage & California burns, it is the same thing -- and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor. You don’t see close to the level of burn in other states...But our teams are working well together in...putting these massive, and many, fires out. Great firefighters! Also, open up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North. Don’t pour it out into the Pacific Ocean. Should be done immediately. California desperately needs water, and you can have it now! [ Emphasis added ]."" In those tweets, Trump clearly indicated that continued federal financial assistance to California (specifically to Newsom) would be contingent upon state officials changing their approach to forest management. That constituted a threat to withdraw federal aid to California for wildfires, and Newsweek was right to describe it as such. What Trump said about Russia In August 2019, the Russian government published a statement about a phone call between Trump and Putin on July 31. That statement read as follows: ""Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with US President Donald Trump this evening at the American side’s initiative. The US President offered help in putting out wildfires in Siberia. The President of Russia expressed sincere gratitude for the kind attention and the offer of help and assistance. Vladimir Putin said he will accept the offer if it becomes necessary. He also told his American colleague that a powerful group of aircraft had been formed in Siberia to fight the wildfires. According to the Emergencies Ministry, solutions have been found to problems with the refuelling and deployment of airplanes and helicopters. ""The President of Russia regards the US President’s offer as a sign that it is possible that full-scale bilateral relations will be restored in the future. The presidents of Russia and the United States agreed to continue contacts in the form of telephone conversations as well as personal meetings."" We asked the White House whether they could corroborate, even broadly, the Russian government's characterization of the call. Unfortunately, we did not receive a response. At the time, a White House spokesperson did not contradict that version of events and told news outlets that, during his conversation with Putin, Trump had ""expressed concern over the vast wildfires afflicting Siberia."" This characterization, combined with the Russian description of an offer to help, means it's perfectly plausible that Trump did make such an offer. We found confirmation that he did in a video of an Aug. 1 press conference during which Trump said the following when reporters asked him about the phone call: ""Mostly we discussed the forest fires in Siberia, and other parts of Russia. And I said, look, we have the greatest equipment, if we could help you let us know. Large sections are burning, and so I said to President Putin, if we can help you, let me know.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1279

Jaclyn Corin, a survivor of the Feb. 14, 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, called the game (which is titled Active Shooter ) ""disgusting"" in a tweet and urged others to sign a petition calling for the game not to be released. (The online petition garnered almost 100,000 signatures within four days.) Ryan Petty, whose 14-year-old daughter Alaina was killed in the shooting rampage, accused Valve Corporation (the Bellevue, Washington, company that runs the Steam platform on which the game would be distributed and run) of ""trying to profit from the glamorization of tragedies affecting our schools across the country"" and also called the game ""disgusting."" The game was indeed real: it was published by a Russian company called Acid and developed by Revived Games (featuring games such as Furry , Tyde Pod Challenge , and White Power: Pure Voltage . which carries the following description: ""The Underworld is an alternate dimension existing in parallel to the human species world. It contains the same parts of the Universe as humanity does, but much more in a darker, colder and hostile manner."")

Only in ""Active Shooter"", you will be able to pick the role of an Elite S.W.A.T member or the actual shooter. A video preview of the game showed a shooter armed with a rifle, handgun, and knife stalking the classrooms and corridors of a school, shooting at both police and civilians while a ""kill counter"" shows the number of ""cops"" and ""civ"" (civilians) the player had murdered. Every civilian shown in the preview video appeared to be female: In a difficult-to-follow post on May 23, 2018, the game's publisher claimed that Active Shooter ""does not promote any sort of violence, especially any soft [sic] of a mass shooting."" The publisher went on to note that the game will probably not allow players to assume the role of the shooter by the time the game is released: After receiving such high amount of critics and hate, I will more likely remove the shooters role in this game by the release, unless if it can be kept as it is right now. We asked Valve Corporation whether Active Shooter would still be released on June 6, 2018, and if so, whether it would still feature the shooter mode. We did not receive a response to our query, but shortly afterwards we noticed that Acid's games were no longer listed among Steam's offerings. Subsequently, the gaming news web site PC Gamer reported that both the publisher and developer of the game -- Acid and Revived Games -- had been removed from the Steam platform. PC Gamer quoted what it called a ""Valve rep"" as saying that the publisher and developer were the same person: This developer and publisher is, in fact, a person calling himself Ata Berdiyev, who had previously been removed last fall when he was operating as '[bc]Interactive' and 'Elusive Team'.

The subjects started struggling with the troopers and were able to disarm Trooper Foerster. One of the men opened fire, killing Trooper Foerster and wounding the other trooper. Despite the wounds, the other trooper was able to return fire and killed of the subject. The three subjects were members of the Black Liberation Army. During her trial, Shakur denied any involvement in either Foerster's death or the shooting of his fellow trooper, James Harper: [Chesimard's] testimony ended suddenly when Mr. Ball asked her, “On that night of May 2nd, did you shoot, kill, execute or have anything to do with the death of Trooper Werner Foerster?” “No,” she replied, shaking her head. “Did you shoot or assault Trooper James Harper?” “No.” The state's case against Mrs. Chesimard, presented over eight weeks through a number of witnesses including Trooper Harper, tells how the trooper stopped white Pontiac bearing Vermont license plates because it had a faulty tail light at about 12:30 A.M. on May 2, 1973. Trooper Harper radioed for back‐up support and Trooper Foerster arrived as Mr. Harper began to question the occupants of the car. Mr. Squire, who was driving, went to the back of the car with Mr. Foerster and soon began scuffling with the trooper. Mr. Harper testified that Mrs. Chesimard reached down toward the floor of the car and the next thing he knew he was shot through the left shoulder. He testified that he had exchanged shots with both occupants of the car and made his way on foot back to the turnpike headquarters nearby. Trooper Foerster's body was found about an hour later. Mr. Squire drove Mr. Costan and Mrs. Chesimard five miles south on the toll road, carried them from the car to grassy spot off the road shoulder and fled when additional state troopers arrived. He was captured the following day. Mrs. Chesimard was wounded and Mr. Costan was dead when the police arrived Shakur was found guilty but escaped from prison in late 1979 and eventually made her way to Cuba, where she was granted political asylum and has lived ever since. Colin Kaepernick's donation to Assata's Daughters was part of a pledge the quarterback made in September 2016 to give a total of $1 million to charity.

Days earlier, CNN reported that Melbourne City police found a brick of cocaine on a beach after a beach-goer reported it as a ""suspicious package."" The officer had the package's contents tested and confirmed that they were cocaine: A beachgoer found the drugs, pointing out a ""suspicious package"" to a patrol officer monitoring the beach, Melbourne city spokeswoman Cheryl Mall told CNN. The officer took the package into custody, and the contents were tested, confirming the cocaine. This brick of cocaine was found a few days after law enforcement discovered another stash of cocaine on Cocoa Beach. Local news outlet Florida Today reported that officers found a duffel bag containing 15 kilos of cocaine worth about $300,000: Cocoa Beach police are asking beachcombers in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian to be cautious about suspicious packages after a duffel bag stuffed with 15 kilos of cocaine washed ashore over. The find — worth at least $300,000 — came before Dorian’s violent stirrings in the Atlantic led to a single brick of cocaine being found along a beach in Melbourne. “There is a possibility that more will come onshore. Especially now with these conditions. It could be coming from anywhere,” said Manny Hernandez, spokesman for the Cocoa Beach Police Department. “We’re telling people to be cautious and not to grab or handle it because if there is an opening, it can go into your pores and you can overdose,” he said. Cocoa Beach Police Sgt. Manny Hernandez told us that this duffel bag of cocaine was found ""pre-Hurricane Dorian"" on Aug. 30, 2019. It's unclear if these two packages were connected. However, as some of the cocaine washed ashore prior to the hurricane, we've marked this article as ""Mostly True."" Here are the facts regarding the cocaine that washed up in Cocoa Beach (Pre-hurricane Dorian): On Friday, August 30, 2019 (pre-hurricane Dorian) at approximately 17:16 (5:16pm), Cocoa Beach Police responded to the Beach End of S. 6th St, Cocoa Beach, FL., in reference to a suspicious package that washed up on shore. The red, travel style duffle bag, was noticed by a beach goer who immediately contacted the police department as the bag appeared suspicious. Responding officers believed the duffle bag contained illegal substance and properly removed it from the beach and transported the bag to the Cocoa Beach Police Department. Upon further inspection, the bag contained 15 small ""bricks"" that were tightly packaged. However, it was believed the packages may contain an unknown narcotic, possibly cocaine. Cocoa Beach Police contacted the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency and notified them of the suspicious bag and contents. A representative/Agent with the agency responded to the Cocoa Beach Police Department the same evening. U.S. Custom and Border Protection Agent inspected the packages and after removing several layers off one of the ""Bricks"", the Agent informed the substance to be cocaine. It is unknown who the duffle bags belongs to and unknown where the cocaine is from. There were no further incidents involving the duffle bag. The bag and the 15 ""Bricks"" (1 Kilo per brick) was turned over to U.S Custom & Border Protection Agent. The street value in the central Florida area is approximately $20K - $30K per ""Brick"" (Kilo). While these news reports may seem unusual, these incidents were not the first time drugs had washed ashore in Florida. In 2016, law enforcement recovered 20 kilos of cocaine worth about $600,000 near Jupiter Island in Martin County.

50b14bcb-b2d1-463f-a339-cd55026d2330,"In September 2018, NRATV (the National Rifle Association's television channel) caused controversy when they digitally added Ku Klux Klan hoods to trains from the long-running children's television program Thomas and Friends during a segment about gender and racial diversity. The segment in question was aired on 7 September 2018, during NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch's show ""Relentless."" The episode is no longer available, though clips are included in the following video: 0:00 / 0:00 Loesch was addressing a recent development on Thomas and Friends which saw two female characters (one of them from Africa) added to the show to bolster its international appeal and give more prominence to female characters: Announcing a new direction for the Thomas and Friends TV show, Mattel said that several changes to the 30-year-old show would help to update the brand’s image and popularity, particularly in Africa and Asia, where the characters and stories were hugely popular. Changes include some new female characters, including Nia, a train engine from Kenya, and Rebecca, a strong-willed, outspoken electric locomotive. Other female characters include an aeroplane from Australia and an Indian train yard controller. The changes are all an effort to modernise the Thomas brand and give it a distinctive international flavour. “We have added new female characters before, but I think, with a show like Thomas , they tend to fall into the background after initial introduction,” said Thomas and Friends producer Ian McCue. “What we wanted to do here was really bring these two female characters to the forefront.” Another of the show’s producers, Micaela Winter, said gender equality was important to the creators in the new series and going forward. Here are the relevant excerpts from Loesch's monologue on the subject, along with the imagery shown on screen along the way: Anyway, [the producers of Thomas and Friends] have decided that the next stop is ""virtue town."" Thomas the Tank is now bringing gender balance to the show by adding girl trains. Seriously. One of those trains, Nia, will be from Kenya to add ethnic diversity to the show. By the way, that's where it gets really strange to me because I've looked at Thomas and Friends, at their pictures, and they seem grey and blue. Am I to understand this entire time that Thomas and his trains were white? Because they all had grey faces. How do you bring ethnic diversity? I mean they had to paint what I guess they thought was some kind of African pattern on the side of Nia's engine? I mean, how do you bring ethnic diversity to a show that literally has no ethnicities, because they're trains! They don't even have skin pigmentation! Was there some concern that the show had racist undertones? Because, I mean, Sir Topham Hatt clearly is white, but the trains? I'm looking at this picture, and I'm really really struggling to understand how in the world there isn't any diversity in any of this ... [Reacting to Ku Klux Klan hoods on screen] Oh. Was it because? I see it. It was the white hoods and the burning train tracks. Ok fine, fair point, I get it. Thomas the Tank Engine has been a blight on race relations for far too long. Clearly, this is overdue, right? So the segment was structured as a joke: Loesch expressed outrage and bafflement about the introduction of female characters, including one from Kenya, then questioned whether the producers of Thomas and Friends were compensating for some previous racism on the show. The fake ""Ku Klux Klan"" image provided a punchline of sorts, with Loesch then theatrically ""accepting"" that there was, in fact, a need for greater diversity on the show. Loesch made some notable omissions and errors in her monologue. First, although she claimed that the show's producers were ""bringing gender balance to the show by adding girl trains,"" Thomas and Friends (and its spin-offs) have featured female characters (including trains) for many years. Some of those characters, including Gina and Frieda, were introduced in the 2016 film The Great Race , but others have been a part of the Thomas universe for much longer. Emily first appeared on the show in 2003, and Annie and Clarabelle (a pair of passenger coaches) were in the original 1946 book Thomas the Tank Engine and the subsequent television series. Second, Loesch failed to mention that the new initiative was part of a collaboration between the United Nations and Mattel, the toy company that own sthe Thomas the Tank Engine brand, to promote five of the U.N.'s 17 ""Sustainable Development Goals"": ﻿ In a press release , Mattel said that newest season of the show would see the characters travel beyond the fictional world of Sodor, to locations in China, India and Australia, and would see the introduction of several new (mostly female) characters from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and nationalities: The series will feature characters from around the world, including the new African steam engine from Kenya called Nia, Ashima from India, Yong Bao from China, and Shane from Australia, as well as host of new female characters ... including Isla, an Aussie flying doctor plane, Noor Jehan, a royal express engine from India, and Hong-Mei, a Number 1 Blue Tank Engine from China. In response to NRATV's ""Ku Klux Klan"" segment, Mattel issued a statement saying that ""We are not associated with images that promote hate and denounce any images of our brands that are being used to convey a message not in line with the values of the company.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1080
09e87b01-d3cb-4e83-9db0-136163db3647,"Editors' Note This article discussed the potential implications of a case that was, at the time of writing, undecided by the Supreme Court. On 17 June 2019 the Supreme Court decided that case, rejecting arguments that could have resulted in a stronger presidential pardon. Far from Kavanaugh's being a deciding vote on the case, the court ruled 7-2 against the notion that Federal and State prosecution for the same crime violates the so-called “double jeopardy clause” of the Constitution. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil M. Gorsuch dissented. On 29 November 2015, a motorist named Terance Gamble , who had been convicted of second degree robbery seven years earlier, was pulled over by an Alabama police officer because of a faulty headlight on his vehicle. Upon searching the car, the officer found a handgun, among other items. It is illegal under both Alabama law and United States law for convicted felons to possess firearms, and Gamble was eventually sentenced to one year in prison on that charge by the state of Alabama. During Gamble's prosecution under Alabama law for possession of a firearm as a felon, the Federal Government also charged him with the same crime. Gamble’s lawyers argued that this second conviction was a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s ban on “double jeopardy,” which is intended to protect people from being prosecuted for the same crime more than once. The double jeopardy clause is found in Fifth Amendment to the U.S. constitution, which states (in part) that ""No person shall ... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” Specifically, the clause has been interpreted to be a prohibition on: Retrials after an acquittal; Retrials after a conviction; Retrials after certain mistrials; and Multiple punishments for the “same offense.” Gamble has been in federal prison since entering a guilty plea on 18 October 2016 that allowed him to appeal his case. In June 2018, the Supreme Court agreed to hear his argument that he has been unconstitutionally punished multiple times for the same crime. While the case is about the constitutionality of a man being charged twice for the same gun possession incident in a narrow sense, the case more broadly has the potential to significantly alter 150 years of Supreme Court precedent. Since the 1850s, the Supreme Court has allowed for one explicit exception to the Constitution’s double jeopardy protections: cases of dual sovereignty (or “separate sovereigns”) which stem from view that the federal government and state governments are distinct entities with occasionally overlapping jurisdictions. (Exceptions to this exception exist which seek to limit double prosecutions at the federal level, but as this case shows they do not always have that effect.) This ”separate sovereigns” exception to double jeopardy, though built on several previous rulings, was made most explicit in a 1920s bootlegging case, United States v. Lanza , which allowed a man to be charged with bootlegging crimes by both the state of Washington and the federal government. With respect to that case, Chief Justice William Howard Taft argued: We have here two sovereignties, deriving power from different sources, capable of dealing with the same subject matter within the same territory. Each may, without interference by the other, enact laws to secure prohibition, with the limitation that no legislation can give validity to acts prohibited by the amendment. Each government, in determining what shall be an offense against its peace and dignity, is exercising its own sovereignty, not that of the other. How Can a Case Overturn a Precedent? The separate sovereigns exemption has for much of its history been a controversial precedent which critics maintain is not rooted in the original text of the Constitution but is instead cobbled together from different partially relevant Supreme Court decisions -- decisions rooted in a time when the federal government was less powerful and whose questions never directly sought to address the explicit matter of double punishment for the same crime in state and federal jurisdictions. This argument is reflected in Gamble’s filing . The government argues in this case that the precedent is well-established through myriad Supreme Court cases and consistent with the Founding Fathers' vision of state and federal government duality: The dual-sovereignty principle has been “long held”, and “consistently endorsed” by this Court, which has recognized its soundness as a matter of “[p]recedent, experience, and reason alike,” The Court explained the roots of the principle more than 150 years ago. And in 1959, the Court described a challenge to the dual-sovereignty doctrine as “not a new question,” having been “invoked and rejected in over twenty cases"" ... Each sovereign is entitled to “exercis[e] its own sovereignty” to “determin[e] what shall be an offense against its peace and dignity” and prosecute the offender “without interference by the other.” Under petitioner’s interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, one sovereign’s efforts (successful or not) to enforce its own laws would vitiate the other sovereign’s similar law-enforcement prerogatives. But that cannot be squared with the Constitution’s bedrock structure of governance. In this case, Gamble has explicitly asked the Supreme Court to rule on a single specific question: “Whether the Court should overrule the “separate sovereigns” exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause.” Why Would President Trump Be Interested in the Outcome of This Case? The reason Gamble v. United States is generating buzz from people other than constitutional law scholars is that the separate sovereigns exception also prevents President Trump from pardoning people for state crimes. Under current Supreme Court precedent, a presidential pardon of an individual does not prevent that individual from being prosecuted for the same or similar crimes under state law. “Under the dual sovereignty doctrine,” Adam J. Adler wrote in the Yale Law Review , “as long as two offenses are defined by different jurisdictions, they cannot constitute the ‘same offense.’” The Congressional Research Service issued an August 2018 report on the potential ramifications of the case, and this report included a discussion of its possible effect on the presidential pardon power: The Gamble case may nevertheless have significant collateral legal effects ... A win for Gamble could also indirectly strengthen the President’s pardon power, by precluding a state from prosecuting an already-pardoned defendant who has gone to trial on an overlapping offense. What Does This Have to Do with Brett Kavanaugh? Some pundits have speculated that the reason why certain politicians seem to be in a rush to seat Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court is that is that he has a notably strong view of presidential powers and therefore would be a vote in favor of Gamble and for an expansion of presidential pardon powers -- and the Supreme Court announced they would be hearing this case the day after Justice Kennedy’s retirement. This temporal proximity has prompted some commenters to opine that the rush might be motivated by a desire to limit the president’s legal liability in the Russia probe and other investigations: While we cannot speculate on the motives of politicians who are supporting Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, The Atlantic reported that prominent political legal scholars agree in a general sense with the view of this case’s having importance with regard to President Trump’s pardon power: Within the context of the Mueller probe, legal observers have seen the dual-sovereignty doctrine as a check on President Donald Trump’s power: It could discourage him from trying to shut down the Mueller investigation or pardon anyone caught up in the probe, because the pardon wouldn’t be applied to state charges. Under settled law, if Trump were to pardon his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for example -- he was convicted in federal court on eight counts of tax and bank fraud -- both New York and Virginia state prosecutors could still charge him for any crimes that violated their respective laws ... If the dual-sovereignty doctrine were tossed ... then Trump’s pardon could theoretically protect Manafort from state action. If Trump were to shut down the investigation or pardon his associates, “the escape hatch, then, is for cases to be farmed out or picked up by state-level attorneys general, who cannot be shut down by Trump and who generally -- but with some existing limits --can charge state crimes even after a federal pardon,” explained Elie Honig, a former assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey. The Atlantic also reported that at least one member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who approved Kavanaugh for a floor vote before the full Senate, Orrin Hatch, has publicly weighed in on the topic (unmotivated, he says, by the implications for the pardon power), filing an Amicus Curiae brief in favor of Gamble which argued that “the pervasive federalization of criminal law to cover conduct that traditionally was prosecuted and punished by the states, and that falls within the states’ core legislative interests, threatens to undermine the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause unless the dual sovereignty doctrine is overruled in this context.” Oral arguments for the case have not been scheduled but will occur during this Supreme Court term. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh could become a deciding vote in the case.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1731
5b305e72-4c71-4780-8e52-afe4d253d701,"Verizon Wireless admitted that they made a ""mistake"" after fire officials in nothern California revealed the company had stifled their data usage amid a historic wildfire in July 2018. According to Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden , the data service provider failed to live up to their policy of lifting data caps in emergency situations when Bowden department asked for help while they battled the Mendocino Complex Fire. As of late August 2018, the fire had consumed more than 400,000 acres of land, making it the largest wildfire in California history. The complaint came to light as part of a lawsuit filed by attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the County of Santa Clara, the Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District, and the California Public Utilities Commission, seeking to overturn the Federal Communication Commission's move to repeal net neutrality rules. Bowden made his allegation in an addendum to an amicus brief filed by the complainants: Verizon representatives confirmed the throttling, but rather than restoring us to an essential data transfer speed, they indicated that County Fire would have to switch to a new data plan at more than twice the cost, and they would only remove throttling after we contacted the Department that handles billing and switched to the new data plan. Bowden said the data throttling primarily affected one specific vehicle, OES 5262, which his department employed to ""track, organize, and prioritize routing of resources from around the state and country to the sites where they are most needed"" during the blaze. The department's plan called for their data speeds to be slowed if they used more than 25 gigabytes a month. ""In the midst of our response to the Mendocino Complex Fire, County Fire discovered the data connection for OES 5262 was being throttled by Verizon, and data rates had been reduced to 1/200, or less, than the previous speeds,"" he wrote. Verizon released a statement conceding that they ""made a mistake"" in discussing the department's plan: Regardless of the plan emergency responders choose, we have a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations. We have done that many times, including for emergency personnel responding to these tragic fires. In this situation, we should have lifted the speed restriction when our customer reached out to us. This was a customer support mistake. We are reviewing the situation and will fix any issues going forward. Verizon rejected the department's contention that the incident could be connected to the repeal of net neutrality rules. However, officials in Santa Clara County said that Verizon's actions during the fire represent conduct that is being encouraged by the repeal. ""Verizon's throttling has everything to do with net neutrality -- it shows that the ISPs will act in their economic interests, even at the expense of public safety,"" said county counsel James Williams.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,541
a2a75329-f9ba-468e-9a97-a8fcef9694d0,"Many conservatives in the United States have long perceived and presented the Democratic party and liberals as being ambivalent or even hostile towards organized religion, especially Christianity. In January 2019, a Fox News report added to fears held by some on the right that the new Democratic majority in the U.S. House of Representatives would attempt to impose its purportedly progressive, secular agenda on that body, including by removing references to ""God"" from the oath required of individuals who testified before one particular House committee: A key committee in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives is moving to eliminate the God reference from the oath administered to witnesses testifying before the panel, as part of a new rules package expected to be approved this week, according to a draft obtained exclusively by Fox News. The draft shows that the House Committee on Natural Resources would ask witnesses to recite only, ""Do you solemnly swear or affirm, under penalty of law, that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"" The rules proposal places the words ""so help you God"" in red brackets, indicating they are slated to be cut. The words ""under penalty of law"" are in red text, indicating that Democrats propose to add that phrasing to the oath. The Fox News report linked to a document that appeared to be a draft of proposed changes to the rules of the House Natural Resources committee, whose chairperson and vice chairs are indeed Democrats. On 30 January, the Natural Resources committee convened and unanimously agreed to re-insert the words ""so help you God"" into the witness oath. After this article was originally published, the committee formally published the earlier draft rules, thus confirming the authenticity of the document Fox News posted online on 29 January. As a result of this authentication, we have changed the rating in this fact check from ""Unproven"" to ""True."" Although the committee subsequently abandoned the plan to remove the phrase from the oath, that took place after Fox News first published its report, which was therefore accurate at the time it was posted. What the document said It is standard procedure for congressional committees to revise and change the rules under which they operate after the swearing-in of a new Congress every two years. The rules of the House Natural Resources Committee for the 115th Congress (from January 2017 to January 2019) contained a section governing how committee hearings should be conducted. As part of those rules, section (e) of Rule 4 set out the oath that was to be sworn by individuals who testified before a hearing of the House Natural Resources Committee: ""(e) Oaths. — The Chairman of the Committee, the Chairmen of the Subcommittees or any Member designated by the Chairman may administer oaths to any witness before the Committee. All witnesses appearing in hearings may be administered the following oath by the Chairman or his designee prior to receiving the testimony: 'Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?'"" According to the draft document originally produced by the same committee (and first published by Fox News), the proposed rules for the same committee in the 116th Congress (which is currently sitting) would have changed the section on oaths by removing the phrase ""so help you God,"" among other alterations: ""(e) Oaths. - The Chair of the Committee, the Chairs of the Subcommittees or any Member designated by the Chair may administer oaths to any witness before the Committee. All witnesses appearing in hearings may be administered the following oath by the Chair or his designee prior to receiving the testimony: 'Do you solemnly swear or affirm, under penalty of law, that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?'"" The phrase ""so help you God"" was explicitly labelled for deletion, rather than being accidentally left out. This is because the document included an introductory note that ""All changes [are] shown in red, with text proposed to be deleted placed in brackets."" And in the original document, ""so help you God"" was placed within brackets and was in red. The following graphic shows Rule 4 (e) from the House Natural Resources Committee rules under the 115th Congress (top) and the draft proposed changes for the 116th Congress (bottom): On 30 January, after this article was published, the Natural Resources committee formally published the original draft of proposed rule changes, which had deleted ""so help you God,"" thus authenticating the document posted by Fox News and confirming the accuracy of the network's report. The committee also posted the "" Manager's Amendment ,"" tabled by Committee Chair Rep. Raúl Grijalva, which proposed re-inserting ""so help you God"" into the text of the witness oath.

A graphic showed Pell, described as ""the third-highest ranking official in the Vatican and currently charged with multiple counts of child sex abuse,"" above a statement attributed to him holding that ""Abortion is a worse moral scandal than priests sexually abusing young people"": In this case, the graphic is accurate on all counts. Pell made the infamous statement during a World Youth Day event in July 2002, in reply to an American youth minister's asking him how Catholics should respond to questions regarding the findings of systematic sexual abuse committed by church officials. When asked to explain his rationale, Pell (who at the time was the Archbishop of Sydney) said, ""Because [abortion] is always a destruction of human life."" The following month, Pell maintained that while the original reporting on his comment did not mention his condemnation of sexual abuse, he would not backtrack on the original statement: I ... mentioned that the church is being attacked for [sex abuse] sometimes by elements that are a bit anti-Christian ... I said there are other scandals, such as abortion which are under-reported and because abortion destroys innocent life you could say it's a worse scandal. On 24 February 2014, Pell (who was by that point a cardinal) was appointed by Pope Francis to oversee the newly-created Secretariat for the Economy, granting Pell ""authority over all economic and administrative activities"" in the Vatican. Since then he has been described by multiple news outlets as being the Vatican's third-highest ranking official. Allegations of sexual abuse against Pell date to 2002 , when he was accused of having molested a 12-year-old boy in 1961. An inquiry commissioned by the National Committee for Professional Standards, a group overseen by the Catholic Church of Australia, determined that the allegations were ""unsubstantiated."" But in June 2017, Pell was charged with historical sexual assault, a term used to an identify alleged offense that took place in the non-recent past. While some of those charges have been dismissed, on 1 May 2018 Pell was ordered to stand trial on other counts. He pleaded not guilty. Coverage of the trial in Australia was suppressed under a court-imposed order, but on 11 December 2018 Pell was reportedly convicted of abusing two choir boys in the country during his tenure as archbishop of Melbourne in the 1990s.

41c88de5-2162-4d13-8111-19c3fd377401,"The fate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hung in the balance in early October 2018 as the Senate Judiciary Committee awaited the results of an FBI investigation into allegations that he had committed a sexual assault some 30 years before -- allegations that Kavanaugh angrily denied in his Senate testimony. The Senate was already sharply divided along party lines on the urgency of pushing ahead with the confirmation, with Democrats demanding a full and unimpeded investigation into the charges and Republicans accusing the Democrats resorting to delaying tactics and attempting to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation. Public opinion was divided as well, with 45 percent of Americans saying they believed Kavanaugh's accuser (Professor Christine Blasey Ford) and 33 percent saying they believed Kavanaugh in an opinion poll taken four days after their testimonies. This clash of opinions played out on social media as uncivil debates raged in which each faction claimed the moral high ground and accused the other of lies and hypocrisy. A meme shared on 1 October took aim at Kavanaugh by calling out a GoFundMe account supposedly established in his and his family's name: The implication, of course, is that as a presumably wealthy and privileged member of the Washington elite, Judge Kavanaugh doesn't need a fundraising account. Other social media users made the same point: Yes, a gofundme page has raised over $100,000 for ‘poor’ Brett Kavanaugh.

RT @thehill : GoFundMe campaign for Kavanaugh raises over $500,000 https://t.co/yfEYSQ1KhW pic.twitter.com/ogImymWxg0 — Trixy Wh (@trixywh) October 4, 2018 Whether or not it addressed an actual financial need on his part (press reports suggest that Kavanaugh, though by no means poor, is less well off as several current members of the Supreme Court), a number of Kavanaugh supporters did launch GoFundMe accounts in his name in late September and early October. The most successful of these had raised more than $600,000 by 5 October. It was opened by John Hawkins of North Carolina, who runs a partisan news and opinion website called Right Wing News . In an introductory note on the GoFundMe page, Hawkins explained the thinking behind it as follows: Like many decent people from both parties, I have been disgusted by the unsubstantiated 36 year old smears aimed at Brett Kavanaugh. We live in a country where innocent until proven guilty is supposed to mean something; yet Brett Kavanaugh's reputation is being dragged through the mud while his family is facing non-stop death threats. This is a horrible way to treat a good man who has dedicated his life to public service. So many unethical people are giving unprovable 36 year old accusations the same weight as 6 FBI background checks, hundreds of hours of hearings and testimony under oath. It is disgraceful. What I'd like to do is raise money for Brett Kavanaugh's family to use for security or however they see fit. All of the money collected will go to Brett Kavanaugh's family or alternately, if they refuse to accept it, to a charity of their choice. I have already reached out to a contact who should be able to put me in touch with Brett Kavanaugh's family. If he can't do it, I have plenty of other contacts who should be able to make it happen. I will update this page after I have talked with his family. I hope you will show your support for a good man who has been treated very, very badly. Hawkins posted updates chronicling his efforts to get in touch with the Kavanaugh family to discuss disbursing the funds. After many unsuccessful attempts he finally spoke to one of the judge's staffers, who told him that although the family is aware of the GoFundMe account and ""extremely appreciative"" of the donations, it would be a while before they could address the question of whether or not Kavanaugh, as a political appointee, can accept the money. On 30 October, Hawkins posted an update which included an ""official statement"" from Kavanaugh's representatives saying he would not accept the funds: ""Justice Kavanaugh did not authorize the use of his name to raise funds in connection with the GoFundMe campaign. He was not able to do so for judicial ethics reasons. Judicial ethics rules caution judges against permitting the use of the prestige of judicial office for fund-raising purposes. Justice Kavanaugh will not accept any proceeds from the campaign, nor will he direct that any proceeds from the campaign be provided to any third party. Although he appreciates the sentiment, Justice Kavanaugh requests that you discontinue the use of his name for any fund-raising purpose."" GoFundMe accounts were also started for Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. The most successful of those had accumulated more than $540,000 in donations as of 5 October. A note from Ford posted on the GoFundMe page expressed her appreciation to all those contributing: I feel like all of you who have made a contribution are on this journey with me, which is very heartening. And some journey it has been and continues to be. We have already had to move four times, our movements are limited even with security, and the threats are ongoing. Thanks to you, I am able to feel safe, my family can be together, and my children can continue to go to school. On 21 November, Ford announced the closure of the GoFundMe account, pledging to donate any unused funds to trauma survivors: The funds you have sent through GoFundMe have been a godsend. Your donations have allowed us to take reasonable steps to protect ourselves against frightening threats, including physical protection and security for me and my family, and to enhance the security for our home. We used your generous contributions to pay for a security service, which began on September 19 and has recently begun to taper off; a home security system; housing and security costs incurred in Washington DC, and local housing for part of the time we have been displaced. Part of the time we have been able to stay with our security team in a residence generously loaned to us. With immense gratitude, I am closing this account to further contributions. All funds unused after completion of security expenditures will be donated to organizations that support trauma survivors. I am currently researching organizations where the funds can best be used. We will use this space to let you know when that process is complete.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1273

As the Grass Valley Union newspaper and other news outlets reported , the Paradise Adventist Academy girls' volleyball team arrived to compete in a California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) playoff game on 10 November 2018 to find that their opponents at Forest Lake Christian High School had provided them with both material and financial support. After the game, Forest Lake athletic director LaRon Gordon announced that local parents and students had donated around $16,000 as well as shoes, clothes, and toiletries to their opponents as well as gift cards for each individual player. Gordon's team also gave Paradise Adventist new jerseys, shorts, and knee pads to use for the contest, which was a semifinal match in the Northern California Division VI regional tournament. Forest Lake also received permission from the CIF to forego charging admission to the game in favor of donating all tickets sales to help victims of the fire. ""I've never been so overwhelmed by so many things I would have never thought possible, and this is one of the most amazing things I could ever have thought would happen,"" Paradise Adventist head coach Jason Eyer said following the announcement. ""Your community is awesome. We will be forever grateful."" Gordon's announcement was also captured in a video posted online: Forest Lake won the game in four sets, though they lost the Division IV regional final to Stone Ridge Christian out of Merced, California, three days later. (We contacted Eyer seeking further comment about his team's memorable away game but did not receive a response prior to publication.) The fire, which erupted on 8 November 2018, had killed 77 people as of 18 November 2018, with another 1,276 people listed as missing in its aftermath. It consumed nearly the entirety of the town of Paradise, a small community in Butte County in northern California, and forced evacuations in several other cities including: Paradise; Centerville; Yankee Hill; Concow; and Butte Creek Canyon. It was also the cause of another disagreement between President Donald Trump and California Gov. Jerry Brown: while Brown cited the fire as a consequence of climate change, the president blamed what he called poor management for the blaze, eliding the fact that some 60 percent of California state forests are under management by federal agencies. More than 50,000 people were reportedly displaced by the blaze, and air quality across the Bay Area decreased as a result of smoke produced by the fire. However, meteorologists predicted that the region would receive some rainfall to alleviate that situation in mid-November 2018.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,500
d5e69c7a-56f7-40e9-ab4b-d844c8905865,"Following President Trump’s return on 11 November 2018 from a controversial visit to France in which he did not attend a memorial commemorating the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I, the White House announced that Trump would not be traveling to Arlington National Cemetery the next day, as reported by Fox News: President Trump is spending Monday at the White House and had no plans to visit Arlington National Cemetery in northern Virginia as America observes the Veterans Day holiday. The White House announced a so-called travel lid at 10 a.m. ET, meaning that the president is not expected to hold any public events or leave the executive mansion. Trump returned to Washington on Sunday evening after a weekend in France, where he attended events commemorating the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I ... On Saturday, Trump was criticized for failing to visit a second American cemetery about 60 miles outside of Paris because bad weather grounded the helicopter he planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president's place. While controversial on its own, the announcement gained more attention on social media when the French Embassy in the United States tweeted photos of French officials taking part in the Arlington National Cemetery wreath-laying ceremony, which had taken place the day before: Yesterday we participated in a ceremony at @ArlingtonNatl to honor the sacrifices of soldiers during #WWI by laying a wreath on the tomb of the #UnknownSoldier . #VeteransDay pic.twitter.com/ZQPbZwMSf6 — French Embassy U.S. (@franceintheus) November 12, 2018 Trump was returning from France during this event, and Mike Pence did not attend in his place.

52ab0ae5-1e92-42b1-b887-4abf175119ba,"The power for states to deny voting rights to persons convicted of crimes has been inferred as constitutional based on section two of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states (emphasis ours): [W]hen the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State. The inference that it would be constitutional for a state to disenfranchise an individual “for participation in rebellion, or other crime” was affirmed most recently in the 1974 Supreme Court case Richardson v. Ramirez . As a result, the power to take away and restore voting rights on the basis of criminal history belongs to the individual states and varies significantly from state to state, as explicated by the National Conference of State Legislatures: In Maine and Vermont, felons never lose their right to vote, even while they are incarcerated. In 14 states and the District of Columbia, felons lose their voting rights only while incarcerated, and receive automatic restoration upon release. In 21 states, felons lose their voting rights during incarceration, and for a period of time after, typically while on parole and/or probation. Voting rights are automatically restored after this time period. Former felons may also have to pay any outstanding fines, fees or restitution before their rights are restored as well. In 13 states felons lose their voting rights indefinitely for some crimes, or require a governor’s pardon in order for voting rights to be restored, or face an additional waiting period after completion of sentence (including parole and probation) before voting rights can be restored. A person convicted of a felony who resided in one of the states that maintain strict felony disenfranchisement laws (such as Florida ) could be barred from regaining voting rights indefinitely. The felony disenfranchisement issue received renewed attention after conservative political commentator Dinesh D’Souza, controversially pardoned by President Donald Trump, took to social media to boast about what he implied were his recently restored voting rights: Felons can’t vote. But pardoned ones can @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz pic.twitter.com/5G7SPelalw — Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) October 30, 2018 D’Souza pled guilty in September 2014 to federal campaign finance law violations and was sentenced to five years of probation, eight months living under supervision in a “community confinement center” in San Diego, and a $30,000 fine. In May 2018, President Trump pardoned D’Souza based on his view that D’Souza had been treated “unfairly.” According to this timeline, D’Souza was still serving his sentence at the time of the pardon. The question at hand, then, is did D’Souza ever actually lose his voting rights in the first place? As explained above, that would depend on where he was registered to vote. According to Vanity Fair , D’Souza has maintained residences in both California and New York. California requires “the Legislature to provide for the disqualification of electors while mentally incompetent or imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony.” D’Souza was neither imprisoned nor released on parole , so he presumably would not have been disenfranchised by California as a result of his probationary status. In New York, the state bars persons “in prison or on parole for a felony conviction” from voting in elections, but it does not bar persons on probation for felony convictions. In fact, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order in April 2018 granting parolees the right to vote (although that order may still be challenged in court). If D’Souza had been planning on voting in New York, he likely would have been able to do so even if President Trump had not pardoned him. The shoutout to Senator Ted Cruz in D’Souza's tweet was likely a reference to Cruz's role in suggesting a pardon of D’Souza to President Trump. However, if D’Souza were claiming to be a voter in Texas -- where felons are barred from voting until their sentences (including probation) are fully served -- or in one of the other states where all felons are disenfranchised for the entirety of their sentences and probationary periods, he could be correct in suggesting his rights were restored via President Trump’s pardon. Update: On 6 November 2018, the State of Florida approved Amendment 4, which restored voting rights to felons (excluding cases of murder or felony sex crimes) who have completed their sentences, as reported by Vox: Florida voters during Tuesday’s midterm elections approved Amendment 4, automatically restoring voting rights in the state for people previously convicted of felonies. Florida’s Amendment 4 restores voting rights for people in the state convicted of felonies as long as they have completed their sentences, although anyone convicted of murder or felony sex offenses would be excluded. Based on the Sentencing Project’s 2016 estimates, this benefits more than a million people. The organization estimated in 2016 that nearly 1.5 million people in Florida have completed felony sentences but can’t vote — about 9.2 percent of the voting-age population in Florida. The total, though, includes some people convicted of murder and felony sex offenses, so not every one of those people benefits under Amendment 4.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1081
ca5381c5-ce5b-41b4-b463-27be07e75fc9,"Officials in Jefferson County, Georgia, faced allegations of racially-motivated voter suppression in October 2018 in response to an incident in which a voter registration group was ordered to return a group of African-American seniors to a county-run senior center, after those seniors boarded a bus to cast ballots during early voting for the November elections. The liberal web site ThinkProgress reported of the incident that: Seniors in rural Georgia were dancing in the street, preparing to board Black Voters Matters bus to cast their ballots Monday, the first day of the state’s early voting period. But the county administrator ordered the senior center to take the 40 or so elderly African Americans off the bus — an act organizers described as “live voter suppression.” In a Facebook video about the incident, which took place on 15 October, the group's co-founders LaTosha Brown and Cliff Albright characterized the county's decision as racially-motivated voter suppression, with Albright saying: Somebody called the County Commission to complain because they saw all these black folks get on this big black bus -- it's the blackest bus in America -- somebody drove past, saw that, got nervous, got mad, called the County Commission's office, which then called the center. And the bottom line was, all the folks who had just got on the bus -- and the bus was full, this is a 50-passenger bus full of folks -- had to come off the bus. There's not a candidate on this bus, there's not a party symbol on this bus, but I'm going to tell you what is on this bus -- a whole bunch of black fists in the air with the word ""power"" underneath it. That's what scared them and made them say ""Those folks have to come off that bus."" However, Jefferson County administrator Adam Brett insisted that the event constituted ""political activity,"" something that the county purportedly does not allow on county property or at county-sponsored events. Jefferson County Democrats Chair Diane Evans was on the bus in question and helped organize the visit to the senior center in the first place, as revealed in email correspondence published by Augusta television station WJBF . Furthermore, Brett said he had not ""vetted"" Black Voters Matter, and that allowing the senior citizens to leave with an unfamiliar outside group could have been a ""liability"" for the county, which operates the senior center in Louisville and also organizes its own chartered buses for seniors to get to polling stations. In a statement sent to us, Brett wrote: The Jefferson County Board of Commissioners has a practice of not allowing political activities during normal business hours on County property or at County sponsored activities. On October 15th, the Senior Center staff declined to allow a third party and unknown bus operator to pick County residents on County property for political purposes. The Senior Center staff routinely arrange Jefferson County Public Transit to transport senior citizens to vote. In an email, Albright rejected Brett's ""liability"" argument, calling it ""paternalistic"" and pointing out that the Louisville senior center is an activities center, not a residential center: Seniors can come [and] go when they please and with whomever they choose to leave with. If they want to leave with a family member, an Uber driver, or an organization they trust, that is their own choice. These are grown adults who decided who they wanted to leave with, and despite Mr. Brett’s paternalistic need to feel comfortable with that decision, he has no control over those choices, nor liability [for them]. We asked Brett what the legal basis was for his order (carried out by staff at the senior center) not to ""allow"" the seniors to travel to the polling station with Black Voters Matter and requested that he clarify Jefferson County's legal authority and liabilities relating to people who use the senior center. We did not receive a response to those questions. Albright told us that staff at the senior center had given advance permission for Black Voters Matter to visit the center and hold an event there, but not for them to escort seniors to polling stations. However, he maintained this was because the group had not initially planned to take the bus trip, which he said the seniors themselves had asked for, spontaneously: The seniors requested to ride the bus to go vote after they saw it and were excited. The center director approved/supported the request, which is why the seniors even got on the bus. It was not until the county administrator called the center director that it became a problem. Albright also questioned the sincerity of Brett's invocation of county policy on ""political activities,"" pointing out that Jody Hice, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives, is scheduled to host an event at the senior center on 27 October. (Albright emphasized that he thought the event in question was very worthy and should be allowed to take place at the center, but he saw it as an example of a double standard.) In fact, on the same day that the seniors were prevented from travelling with Black Voters Matter to a polling station, the Jefferson County Board of Commissioners actually promoted Congressman Hice's event at the senior center on their Facebook page, in a post that was taken word-for-word from Hice's earlier press release : We asked Brett to explain why the county had forbidden an event in which a bus carrying a local Democratic party official -- but no elected politician or candidate -- was to escort seniors to a polling station away from the center itself, but allowed a sitting Republican Congressman, who is actively campaigning for re-election , to host an event in the center itself. We also asked why the Board of Commissioners had promoted that event. We did not receive a response to those questions. In a separate Facebook post , the Board of Commissioners explained that the bus trip had been forbidden because it ""was led by the President of the Jefferson County Democratic Party [Diane Evans] and as such was considered a political event."" However, the Black Voters Matter's visit had been organized with the assistance of Evans, and yet it was still allowed to take place. We asked Brett why the Black Voters Matter visit was allowed to go ahead despite the involvement of Evans, but the bus trip was not, and asked whether he had considered requesting that Evans disembark the bus (given that her involvement was purportedly the source of the county's objections) rather than ordering the seniors to return to the center. Again, we did not receive a response to these questions. Conclusion It is true that on 15 October 2018, staff at the Jefferson County senior center in Louisville enacted the instructions of County Administrator Adam Brett by insisting that a group of seniors return to the center after they voluntarily boarded a bus operated on behalf of Black Voters Matter, a voter registration group. The leaders of that group characterized the incident as racially-motivated voter suppression, but Brett insisted otherwise, stating that the reasons for his order were twofold: the involvement of Jefferson County Democrats Chair Diane Evans meant that the bus trip constituted ""political activity,"" something the county could not allow, and county officials had not vetted Black Voters Matter or the bus operator, creating a potential liability for the county which Brett was unwilling to assume. However, it must be acknowledged that significant problems exist with the coherence of the twofold rationale outlined by Brett. First, it is not clear that Jefferson County actually has any legal liability for anything that happens to those who use the center once they have left the center. Likewise, it's not clear that Brett had any legal authority to ""not allow"" seniors to travel to the polling station or Black Voters Matter to escort them there. Second, the consistency with which Jefferson County enforces their prohibition on ""political activities"" at the senior center is questionable. On the one hand, Brett forbade the bus trip to the polling station on this basis due to the involvement of a local Democratic official, even though the bus trip would have taken the seniors away from the senior center, and even though the county allowed a visit to the senior center which had been organized with the help of that same Democratic official. But Jefferson County's Board of Commissioners also sanctioned a forthcoming event to be hosted by Jody Hice, a sitting Republican Congressman and active election candidate, which is scheduled to take place in the center itself, and the Board of Commissioners has promoted that event on Facebook in a post taken word-for-word from Hice's earlier press release.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1628
dd07aade-5d28-43a5-88d8-dffcd4bbd273,"On 19 September 2018, Bust magazine highlighted the disturbing fact that doctors and medical students regularly, and legally, give anesthetized patients non-consensual pelvic exams. The practice was described in detail in an account critical of the practice written by then-medical student Shawn Barnes and published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology in 2012: In obstetrics and gynecology, I encountered the first act of medical training that left me ashamed. For 3 weeks, four to five times a day, I was asked to, and did, perform pelvic examinations on anesthetized women, without specific consent, solely for the purpose of my education. Typically this would unfold as follows: I would be assigned a gynecologic surgery case on which to scrub in. I would be required to go meet the patient beforehand and introduce myself as “the medical student on the team” or some such vague statement of my role in the procedure, without mentioning a pelvic examination. I then would follow the patient into surgery. Once anesthesia was administered and the patient was asleep, the attending or resident would ask me to perform a pelvic examination on the patient for educational purposes. To my shame, I obeyed. An essay published on the XOJane website recounted the unease one woman felt attempting to find out if someone had performed such an exam on her during a recent surgery: I called my gynecologist’s office, and I tried to calm my rising panic as I explained my concerns that I had been given pelvic exams by random medical students while I was unconscious in the operating room. The receptionist seemed as alarmed as I did, and she reassured me that my doctor would never have allowed such a thing and that he would contact me as soon as possible. I scoured the papers I’d received from the hospital to see if anything hidden in the fine print gave them permission to do such things without express informed consent, which they did not ... A few hours later, [the doctor] called me back. He asked me what my concerns were, so I explained that I was concerned that a med student or two or three had performed non-consensual pelvic exams on my unconscious body. As I recounted, I tried to stay as calm as possible, fighting back the tide of hysteria that threatened to drown my sanity. As soon as I finished speaking, he responded brusquely that he does so many surgeries that he could not say for sure whether or not it had happened ... Okay, I said, then I have one final question: have you done this in the past? Have you had medical students perform pelvic exams on unconscious patients? Yes, he replied gruffly, and it’s a commonly accepted practice. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, and the Association of American Medical Colleges has each condemned the practice, but it remains legal in the vast majority of American states. While teaching hospitals do provide consent forms indicating that medical students may be involved with their care, these forms do not necessarily require the explicit disclosure of pelvic exams, and often times multiple students will perform the same exam on a patient or perform it in cases when is medically unnecessary: Ordinarily, consent forms at teaching hospitals will include language to inform the patient that medical students may be involved in their care. Patients are informed that (1) they are receiving care from a teaching hospital and (2) that medical students may be involved in their care ... But there are cases where an instructor or attending doctor wants more than one student to examine the same patient or to have students examine patients for whom the particular pelvic examination is not indicated. According to a 2018 review paper , several scholarly efforts have demonstrated that the practice is common: In 2003, Ubel et al surveyed 400 medical students from five medical schools in Philadelphia, 90% of whom admitted to having performed a pelvic exam on an anesthetized woman, although it was not clear how many of the women had consented to the exam. A similar survey at the University of Oklahoma in 2005 found that a large majority of medical students had given pelvic exams to gynecologic surgery patients who were under anesthesia, and that in nearly three quarters of these cases the women had not consented to the exam. Coldicott et al published findings from a medical school in the United Kingdom in which students anonymously reported that at least 24% of intimate examinations they performed on anesthetized patients occurred without any consent and that ‘on many occasions, more than one student examined the same patient’. The practice is explicitly outlawed in Hawaii, California, Illinois, Virginia, and Oregon , but it is legal in the remaining 45 states.  In 2019, however, multiple states introduced legislative bills aimed at requiring that women undergoing gynecological surgeries give explicit approval to  pelvic exams beforehand",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,913
c0e5b4a4-4a14-4993-8dc3-d40a30539c35,"In September 2018, Nike's announcement of a commercial deal with free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick prompted fierce debate over the national anthem protests led by Kaepernick, as well as widespread calls for a boycott of Nike products. Kaepernick began to ""take a knee"" during the playing of the national anthem in 2016 as a protest against racial injustice and police brutality and was at the forefront of such protests among National Football League players and staff. In the days following the announcement, we received multiple enquiries from readers about a letter purportedly written by the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) which called upon its members to boycott Nike. The letter is authentic and was issued by NAPO president Michael McHale, addressed to Nike CEO Mark Parker. NAPO is a law enforcement union founded in 1978 and described as representing 241,000 officers from more than 1,000 police organizations. The letter , dated 4 September, read as follows: On behalf of the more than 241,000 law enforcement officers represented by our Association across the country, I write to you to condemn in the strongest possible terms your selection of Colin Kaepernick for Nike’s “Just Do It” ad campaign. Mr. Kaepernick is known, not as a successful athlete, but as a shallow dilettante seeking to gain notoriety by disrespecting the flag for which so many Americans have fought and died ... In featuring Mr. Kaepernick in the “Just Do It” campaign, Nike grossly insults the men and women who really do make sacrifices for the sake of our nation. We are calling on all our member officers, their families and friends to join in boycotting all Nike products. NAPO was joined in critizing Nike and Kaepernick by the National Fraternal Order of Police, whose president, Chuck Canterbury, issued a press release addressing (but not calling for) a boycott of Nike: Press Release on Nike ""Since 2016, 381 cops have been killed in the line of duty. They believed in something and sacrificed everything as did the families they left behind. All of the men and women in law enforcement believe in something and are prepared to sacrifice everything"" pic.twitter.com/j4OkjUxR4S — National FOP (@GLFOP) September 5, 2018 The Fraternal Order of Police has been called upon to boycott Nike for capitalizing on this former professional football player because he attracts controversy. In our experience, boycotts and similar exercises do not succeed and often serve only to enrich the company -- which is not what we want to do. Our members and, for that matter, any American citizen understands when the law enforcement profession is being insulted -- we have no doubt they will make their purchases with that insult in mind. These vehement criticisms sparked something of a controversy among police unions, with the National Black Police Association (NBPA) issuing a strong rejection of McHale's letter. On 5 September, NBPA chairperson Sonia Y.W. Pruitt wrote a letter of her own to Nike's CEO, offering the support of her organization's members: The National Black Police Association is not in agreement with NAPO on this matter, and we strongly condemn their call for police officers and their families to boycott Nike and its products ... NAPO believes that Mr. Kaepernick's choice to openly protest issues surrounding police brutality, racism and social injustices in this country makes him anti-police. On the contrary, the NBPA believes that Mr. Kaepernick's stance is in direct alignment with what law enforcement stands for -- the protection of a people, their human rights, their dignity, their safety, and their rights as American citizens ... The NBPA proudly supports Nike and your use of Mr. Kaepernick in you new ""Just Do It"" advertising campaign...We will likely be buying and wearing Nike products in the near future.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,701
63827123-f971-4911-8639-1171ceba2abb,"Dec. 10, 2019 Update: The regulations discussed in this fact check went into effect on June 24, 2019 . For more information on why we dispute the EPA's characterization of their “Significant New Use Rule” for asbestos, please read this additional September 2018 article on the topic. On 1 June 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics announced a proposed “Significant New Use Rule” (SNUR) for asbestos, a mineral once widely used in the construction of buildings due to its flame-retardant properties but now uncontroversially considered a carcinogen . The necessity for such a rule, in general, stems from the fact that not all uses of asbestos are currently banned; some of them remain unregulated thanks to a 1991 court ruling. The asbestos uses the 2018 SNUR applies to are ones that had not been banned by earlier regulations and remained in active use at the time of the 1991 court ruling , but are no longer in use due to users' desires to avoid contracting cancer or liability for causing cancer in others. The EPA refers to these uses as ""currently unregulated former uses."" SNURs are a mechanism within the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that mandate specific EPA approval when a chemical is used in a significantly new way or in a significantly new mixture that “might create concerns.”: For asbestos, [the] EPA is proposing a SNUR for certain uses of asbestos (including asbestos-containing goods) that would require manufacturers and importers to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, and importing or processing of asbestos. This review process would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use of asbestos and, when necessary, take action to prohibit or limit the use. The TSCA is currently undergoing a major overhaul that began under the Obama administration and was reinterpreted in radically divergent ways under the Trump administration. When former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt (a Trump appointee who resigned amid accusations of misconduct) explained the proposed SNUR for asbestos, he described it as part of an “unprecedented” set of new protections against the dangers of asbestos which require manufacturers ""to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, and importing or processing of asbestos"". In their correspondence with us, the EPA stated that the proposed rule serves ""to ensure that the manufacture, import, or processing for the currently unregulated former uses of asbestos identified in the rule are prohibited unless reviewed and approved by EPA."" According to critics, the problem with this position is twofold. The first problem concerns the way in which the current EPA has written the SNUR, which EPA staffers have privately worried does not allow for the ban of all currently inactive unregulated uses but instead only concerns 15 specific uses the EPA ""believes"" to be comprehensive and thus could allow for the continued legality of some now dormant uses. The second problem concerns the way in which the EPA has proposed to evaluate the risk of these ""currently unregulated former uses"". In May 2018, the EPA published a document known as the “Problem Formulation of the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos,” which establishes the scientific approach the EPA will take in evaluating these new uses. Significantly, their approach will not include information from existing (or “legacy”) uses of asbestos, despite the significant body of work around health risks stemming from those uses: In the case of asbestos, legacy uses, associated disposals, and legacy disposals will be excluded from the problem formulation and risk evaluation ... These include asbestos containing materials that remain in older buildings or are part of older products but for which manufacture, processing and distribution in commerce are not currently intended, known or reasonably foreseen. EPA is excluding these activities because EPA generally interprets the mandates under section TSCA § 6(a)-(b) to conduct risk evaluations and any corresponding risk management to focus on uses for which manufacture, processing or distribution is intended, known to be occurring, or reasonably foreseen, rather than reaching back to evaluate the risks associated with legacy uses, associated disposal, and legacy disposal, and interprets the definition of conditions of use in that context. E&E News reported that this approach may serve to severely limit the types of exposures the EPA will consider when formulating the potential risk of new uses for asbestos: Public health advocates believe EPA is inappropriately limiting its health reviews of chemicals to avoid considering the impacts of those already in the environment. But the agency hasn't been swayed by their pushback ... That means the agency won't consider the dangers posed by, for example, asbestos-containing tiles, adhesives and piping in millions of homes and commercial buildings nationwide. According to the New York Times , the new rules will serve to narrow the ways in which asbestos itself is defined as well: Other changes identified in the E.P.A. documents narrow the definitions of certain chemicals, including asbestos. Some asbestos-like fibers will not be included in the risk assessments, one agency staff member said, nor will the 8.8 million pounds a year of asbestos deposited in hazardous landfills or the 13.1 million pounds discarded in routine dump sites. Three former EPA officials, including the former supervisor of the toxic chemical program, told the New York Times that such stipulations would necessarily create flawed analyses of the threat posed by any chemical currently being re-evaluated by the EPA: Three former agency officials, including a former supervisor of the toxic chemical program, said that the E.P.A.’s approach would result in a flawed analysis of the threat presented by chemicals. “It is ridiculous,” said Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, who retired last year after nearly four decades at the E.P.A., where she ran the toxic chemical unit during her last year. “You can’t determine if there is an unreasonable risk without doing a comprehensive risk evaluation” ... The most likely outcome of the changes will be that the agency finds lower levels of risks associated with many chemicals, and as a result, imposes fewer new restrictions or prohibitions, several current and former agency officials said. Senator Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico, argued that former EPA head Scott Pruitt was undermining a bipartisan push to reform the TSCA that began under President Obama. “Congress worked hard in bipartisan fashion to reform our nation’s broken chemical safety laws, but Pruitt’s E.P.A. is failing to put the new law to use as intended,” he said in a statement. President Trump spoke on the topic of asbestos long before his election to the White House. In his 1997 book The Art of the Comeback , Trump argued that the chemical is actually safe once applied and suggested that the link to health problems was manufactured by mob-connected companies which perform asbestos removal: ""I believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob, because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal. Great pressure was put on politicians, and as usual, the politicians relented."" While it is true that the uses of asbestos discussed in the 2018 SNUR are currently legal, their health and litigation risks have rendered them effectively dead . The current administration has established a process for some of those uses to be granted formal approval by the EPA if they pass a safety review many scientists find flawed. For these reasons, we concur with the leaked opinion of EPA lawyer Mark Seltzer, an attorney advisor to the EPA Chemical Risk and Reporting Enforcement Branch who worked on the SNUR and concluded that: “This new approach allows asbestos-containing products that are not currently used to be used in the future.”",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1436
4550f8ae-edd4-4391-9e8d-88e364b784fd,"In July 2018, an investigation by the conservative Middle East Forum think tank hit the headlines, after it appeared to reveal that an office within the U.S. Treasury Department had in 2015 signed off on the transfer of $125,000 to the Islamic Relief Agency, a Sudan-based group listed as a funder of terrorism by the Treasury itself. The 25 July Middle East Forum (MEF) report , which was accompanied by an article in the conservative National Review , reported: The Middle East Forum has discovered that the Obama administration approved a grant of $200,000 of taxpayer money to an al-Qaeda affiliate in Sudan — a decade after the U.S. Treasury designated it as a terrorist-financing organization. More stunningly, government officials specifically authorized the release of at least $115,000 of this grant even after learning that it was a designated terror organization. The report gave rise to coverage by the right-wing Daily Wire web site, which attributed the funding decision to former president Barack Obama personally in a headline reading ""Obama Knowingly Funded Designated Al-Qaeda Affiliate,"" as well as by Fox News , which reported: The Obama administration approved a $200,000 grant to a group in Sudan with ties to Al Qaeda even though it had been designated a terrorist-financing organization by the U.S. years earlier, a conservative think tank revealed. Further, an agency official acknowledged the prior administration allowed taxpayer money to flow to the group even after its designation was discovered. The facts and sequence of events presented by the MEF are broadly accurate and were largely confirmed to us by an official from the international charity World Vision, which acted in partnership with the Islamic Relief Agency (ISRA) in Sudan until 2015. However, contrary to the Daily Wire's headline, we found no evidence that former president Barack Obama himself had any role in either of the two funding decisions related to ISRA which are at the heart of the MEF's report. Background In 2004, the U.S. Treasury Department added the Islamic Relief Agency and several individuals associated with it to a list of organizations and individuals suspected of funding terrorism, blocking its assets and bank accounts in the United States and making it a criminal offense for anyone in the United States to support or conduct financial transactions with ISRA. In announcing their decision , the Treasury Department cited evidence that ISRA (and its officials) had links to Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and others within global Islamic terrorist networks. Apart from its inclusion on the U.S. government's list of terrorism funders, ISRA performed charitable works in parts of the Muslim world — including Sudan, where they partnered with the U.S.-based evangelical Christian non-profit organization World Vision, which in turn received funding and support from the U.S. government, largely through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Sequence of Events In March 2014, USAID signed off on a $723,405 grant to World Vision, with ISRA designated to receive a $200,000 sub-grant from that amount. A World Vision official closely involved in the matter told us that, before listing ISRA as a sub-grantee, the organization had searched the Treasury's ""Sanctions List"" for any group operating in Sudan with ""Islamic Relief"" in their name but turned up no matches, indicating ISRA was not blocked. A USAID official told us that the $200,000 set aside for ISRA was to go towards humanitarian aid to people displaced by the ongoing conflict in Sudan at that time. In November 2014, according to the World Vision official with whom we spoke, the organization was alerted to the possibility that ISRA might be on the Treasury's list of blocked groups and conveyed those concerns to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is responsible for implementing and tracking economic sanctions. The official told us that World Vision then voluntarily stopped working with ISRA while OFAC investigated ISRA's status. This contradicted the account of a USAID official, who told us that USAID had instructed World Vision to put a hold on all their activities with ISRA. The World Vision official broadly confirmed MEF's claims, which were based on emails released under the Freedom of Information Act, that World Vision was eager for OFAC to quickly clarify the status of ISRA, telling us that the organization was frustrated by the delay in what should have been a straightforward verification of records. In January 2015, OFAC finally confirmed that the Sudan-based Islamic Relief Agency to which USAID had granted $200,000 was indeed on the U.S. Treasury's sanctions list. This meant World Vision (like any other U.S.-based entity or person) could not provide ISRA any support or engage in any financial transactions with that group. However, World Vision still owed ISRA money for services ISRA had already provided in Sudan, on the basis of the $200,000 sub-grant awarded by USAID the previous March. But OFAC's January 2015 ruling meant that ISRA could not be reimbursed for that work, so World Vision applied to OFAC for a license to meet those contractual obligations. The World Vision official told us that the indefinite halt to their work with ISRA had put a severe strain on World Vision's relationship with the Sudanese government. World Vision staff in Sudan had been experiencing harassment related to their debts to ISRA, the official said, and they felt they were at real risk of being kicked out of the country altogether — which would have spelled the end of their humanitarian work there. Paying their remaining debts to ISRA felt like the cost and condition of World Vision's being allowed to continue working in Sudan, the official told us. In the end, OFAC accepted World Vision's application and granted them a license for a one-off transfer of $125,000 to ISRA, which a USAID official told us was for humanitarian assistance work that ISRA had already performed. A World Vision spokesperson told us that the $125,000 transferred to ISRA came from ""USAID funds,"" confirming both the Middle East Forum and Fox News' description of it as ""taxpayer money."" In a statement, the spokesperson wrote: World Vision received reimbursement of $125,000 from USAID of funds paid to ISRA for expenses they incurred and reported under that sub-grant. Conclusion The Middle East Forum is correct in their central claim that an office of the Treasury Department, which had confirmed ISRA was listed as a sanctioned entity, subsequently permitted a private NGO (World Vision) to transfer funds to ISRA. Insofar as every office and agency of every federal government department between 2009 and 2016 was a part of the ""Obama administration,"" it can justifiably be said that this decision was made by the Obama administration. However, we saw no evidence that the decision was made by anyone beyond OFAC, least of all by President Obama himself. We asked the Treasury Department which official directed the license to be given to World Vision for the May 2015 transfer, but an official told us OFAC does not discuss or comment on individual cases. We also contacted John Smith, who was OFAC's director during the period outlined by the Middle East Forum, but did not receive a response in time for publication.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1332
85e2550e-538a-4020-96af-18d05255f9d5,"Stephen Miller, a senior advisor to President Trump, is often described as the architect of some of Donald Trump’s most exclusionary immigration policies, including the chaotically executed “Muslim ban” and calls to build a border wall. Formerly a member of senator-turned-Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ communication staff, he has played a central role in developing the “zero tolerance policy” announced by Sessions on 6 April 2018, which resulted in thousands of children forcibly separated from their parents at the southern border of the United States. On 20 June 2018, widespread public outrage lead the President to sign a vague executive order directing immigration officials to imprison both parents and children together, but Miller remains in favor of the zero tolerance policy and its use as a deterrent against illegal immigration. Memes and think pieces have suggested that Miller’s policy recommendations — which serve to prevent poor or persecuted immigrants from coming into the United States from Latin American countries as well as block people from predominantly Muslim countries — are hypocritical, as his own family is descended from Jewish immigrants who arrived with no money and unable to speak English, escaping the pogroms and poverty of the Russian Empire. Factually speaking, this is an accurate description of how Miller’s mother’s family came to the United States. Stephen Miller’s mother belongs to the Glosser family, which has its ancestral roots in the currently Belarusian (but formerly Russian) city of Antopol . One branch of the family found themselves in Johnstown, Pennsylvania and eventually become proprietors of a prominent department store (named, appropriately, Glosser Bros. Department Store.) That business was so influential to the community that its history was published in 2014, on the 25th anniversary of its closing. That book describes the family’s immigrant origins: We're not sure what last name they had in the Old Country...though members of the family listed the name ""Glotzer"" on their paperwork when they finally emigrated to America. Whatever their last name, the husband and wife who were destined to someday become the Glossers of Johnstown were just Wolf Leib and Bessie of the Eastern European town of Antopol, which was part of the Russian Empire. [...] [Wolf and Bessie] came to Ellis Island on January 7, 1903 aboard the German ship the S.S. Moltke. According to the ship's manifest, he had a grand total of $8.00 in his possession. The early 1900s saw a violent, rising antisemitism in the Russian Empire — an infamous period of history known for the pogroms , which resulted in thousands of Jewish people murdered in brutal, state-sponsored mob violence: When the czar was assassinated in 1881, the crime was blamed, falsely, on a Jewish conspiracy, and the government launched a wave of state-sponsored massacres known as pogroms. Hundreds of Jewish villages and neighborhoods were burned by rampaging mobs, and thousands of Jews were slaughtered by Russian soldiers and peasants. The pogroms caused an international outcry, but they would continue to break out for decades to come. Between 1900 and 1914, when the first Glossers arrived in America, 1.5 million Jews had emigrated from Eastern Europe to escape famine and bloodshed; of those, a vast majority settled in the United States. An 1898 article published in the Atlantic captured the sentiment of Russian Jews during this time: There is no hope for Israel in Russia. The salvation of the downtrodden people lies in other parts, in a land beyond the seas, which knows no distinction of race or faith, which is a mother to Jew and Gentile alike. In the great republic is our redemption from the brutalities and ignominies to which we are subjected in this our birthplace. In America we shall find rest; the stars and stripes will wave over the true home of our people. To America, brethren! To America! Before 1924, there were no immigration laws in existence that the Glossers could have broken (or abided by) during their journey, making it much easier to find legal refuge in the United States as an Eastern European then than it is for those seeking asylum in the United States in 2018. The author of the Glosser Bros. Department Store's history book imagined the family's relief once they arrived: Imagine living in a place where armed Cossacks ride through the streets, looking to cripple or kill you. A place where the non-Jewish peasants sic their dogs on your children. Where the threat of ethnic massacres, or pogroms, constantly hangs over your head. Where your home has a dirt floor, a thatched roof, and no indoor plumbing, and you barely scrape by, selling kerosene, salt, and potato bread in a humble market stall. Now you know how the Glossers felt before they came to Johnstown. One of the founding brothers of Glosser Bros. — Sam Glosser, son of Wolf and Bessie — is the great-grandfather of Stephen Miller. In response to a story highlighting Miller’s connection to Johnstown published in the local Tribune-Democrat , Miller’s uncle David Glosser — who once wrote, “I wish Stephen career success and personal happiness, however I cannot endorse his political preferences” — left a detailed account of his family's roots: Starting with exactly nothing, one branch of the family established the scrap yard business, and our branch built Glosser Brother's department store. [...] We thrived. This was the miracle of America. While there was always a certain amount of anti-Jewish prejudice, it was not universal or state sponsored, we had equal protection of the law, freedom of speech and religion, and we enjoyed good relations with our neighbors. [...] My nephew [Stephen Miller] and I must both reflect long and hard on one awful truth. If in the early 20th century the USA had built a wall against poor desperate ignorant immigrants of a different religion, like the Glossers, all of us would have gone up the crematoria chimneys with the other six million kinsmen whom we can never know. In a 19 June 2018 interview (whose on-the-record audio the New York Times controversially withheld at the request of the White House), Miller described the intended goals of the so-called “zero-tolerance policy” that separated children from their parents as one meant to dissuade people from thinking they could successfully seek refuge in the United States: From where Mr. Miller sits, illegal immigration is driven by a belief among people outside the United States that those who make it across the border will be allowed to stay indefinitely. “The success rate is the predominant factor that drives illegal migration,” he told us. By instituting a zero-tolerance policy, Mr. Miller said, the administration is sending a message that should reduce the flow of illegal immigration into the country. The Glossers, of course, have remained in America indefinitely since their arrival in 1903. So successful have they been, in fact, that one of their descendants is currently a senior advisor to that nation’s highest office. While a lack of immigration laws for Europeans in the 1900s would have made an official asylum request unnecessary, the Glossers did escape state-sponsored ethnic persecution — conditions that could legally form the basis of an asylum claim under the modern immigration system — by seeking refuge in America. As such, we rank the claim that Miller is descended from asylum seekers as true.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1388
7c7cba22-1708-4477-b05d-e77d80fc3eac,"United States President Donald Trump took another swipe at Canada on 19 June 2018 during a speech about ""smugglers"" bringing shoes into the country from the United States, by mixing two pieces of a New York Post story. Trump, speaking at an event hosted by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), said: There was a story two days ago in a major newspaper talking about people living in Canada, coming into the United States and smuggling things back into Canada because the tariffs are so massive. The tariffs to get common items back into Canada are so high that they have to smuggle them in. They buy shoes and they wear them. They scuff them up to make them sound old, or look old. No, we're treated horribly. The president did not identify the ""major newspaper"" that supposedly printed the story, but his statement was based on an op-ed published in the Post three days earlier by reporter Isabel Vincent. She wrote: A Canadian who once lived in Vancouver told me he would cross the border into Seattle to buy outdoor equipment that he simply couldn't find in Canada. ""Before we crossed back into Canada, we'd remove the price tags and make sure that the new equipment looked as dusty as possible,"" he said. Vincent, who said Canadian friends relied on her to help them bring goods across the border, also shared an anecdote regarding shoes, though it did not involve changing their appearance: A Toronto-based designer I know purchased two pairs of shoes (retail $800 each) online from a midtown department store and shipped them to my office. The Italian contraband sat under my desk for weeks until I could entrust them to a carrier who would be crossing the border. I finally convinced my nephew who had been visiting New York to stuff them into his back-pack and rendezvous with the designer in Toronto for the drop-off. My friend saved $159.59 in combined federal and provincial taxes, and $187.26 in estimated customs charges. The NFIB did not respond to a request for comment concerning the remark. The Footware Distributors and Retailers of America, though, rebuked Trump for his comment in a statement. The trade group's president and CEO Matt Priest said that ""anyone from anywhere"" was welcome to purchase shoes in the United States: The President seems misinformed about footwear trade. Consumers buying shoes in America already pay a very high tariff, upwards of 37.5 percent and 67.5 percent. NAFTA is not treating footwear consumers in America unfairly, the American government itself has not lowered footwear duties in a meaningful way in over 80 years. If the President is concerned about treating American footwear companies and consumers fairly, then he should have signed the TPP to lower footwear costs in America. Canada signed the TPP and will eventually get duty free shoes from Vietnam, a major sourcing hub, where American brands will ship directly into Canada duty free. Canadian’s have no real reason to ""smuggle"" their shoes because their government is already helping lower their costs through proper trade deals. The Canadian government does not identify any specific limitations on bringing American footwear into the country. Most goods worth more than 200 Canadian dollars are subject to duty and taxes if brought in more than 24 hours after purchase. Trump's remark was the latest in a series of verbal attacks against Canada and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, accusing the country of taking economic advantage of the U.S. He has also threatened that the U.S. would exit its partnership in the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and did not discount that possibility in his remarks at the NFIB event, saying: We're trying to equalize it. It's not easy but we're getting there. We'll see whether or not we can make a reasonable NAFTA deal.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,725
6c1f780d-f653-42a3-a1e0-73850c5689d1,"In April 2018, the right-leaning Turning Point USA posted a Facebook meme which attacked Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for once supporting a proposal to ""dump nuclear waste"" in a ""poor Latino community in Texas"": In the 90's, Trump supported a bill to dump nuclear waste in Sierra Blanca, a poor Latino community in Texas where the average yearly income was $8,000. When asked if he would visit the site, he said ""Absolutely not."" Oh wait! Never mind, that was Bernie Sanders! And he actually co-sponsored the bill! The meme was re-posted by the ""Capitalism"" Facebook page: In 1997 and 1998, Sanders did indeed support a measure that gave Congressional approval to an arrangement that would have allowed the states of Maine and Vermont to transport and dispose of nuclear waste at a proposed site in the sparsely populated town of Sierra Blanca in Hudspeth County, close to the Mexican border in West Texas. As the meme suggests, Sierra Blanca was (and is) a predominantly Latino community. U.S. Census Bureau records show that in 2000, two years after the proposal, 73 percent of the town's 533 residents identified as Hispanic or Latino, and almost all of those as Mexican. In 2016, some 69 percent of Sierra Blanca's 557 residents identified as Hispanic or Latino. In 1999, the annual per capita income of Sierra Blanca residents was $10,768, which was 45 percent lower than that of Texans at large ($19,617). In 2016, the median household income in Sierra Blanca was estimated to be $41,875 as compared to $54,727 in the state of Texas. As an Independent member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Vermont, Sanders was one of 23 co-sponsors of House Resolution 629 , which called for Congress to give its consent to the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact — an agreement between the states of Texas, Maine, and Vermont. Speaking on the floor of the house in October 1997, Sanders said he was in ""strong support"" of the resolution for environmental reasons, and stressed that he personally was opposed to the use of nuclear power, but that the waste it produces had to be disposed of as safely as possible. It is worth reading a relatively extensive excerpt from his remarks in order to get a good sense of Sanders' stated reasoning: Let me touch, for a moment, upon the environmental aspects of this issue. And let me address it from the perspective of someone who is an opponent of nuclear power, opposes the construction of nuclear power plants and if he had his way, would shut down the existing nuclear power plants as quickly and as safely as we could. One of the reasons that many of us oppose nuclear power plants is that when this technology was developed, there was not a lot of thought given as to how we dispose of the nuclear waste. But...the reality, as others have already pointed out, is that the waste is here. We can't wish it away. It exists in power plants in Maine and Vermont, it exists in hospitals, it is here...So the real environmental issue here is not to wish it away, but to make the judgement, the important environmental judgement as to what is the safest way of disposing of the nuclear waste that has been created. ...Leaving the radioactive waste at the site where it was produced -- despite the fact that that site might be extremely unsafe in terms of long-term isolation of the waste, and was never intended to be a long-term depository of low-level waste  -- is horrendous environmental policy...No reputable scientist of environmentalist believes that the geology of Vermont or Maine would be a good place for this waste. In the humid climate of Vermont and Maine, it is more likely that ground water will come in contact with that waste and carry off radioactive elements to the accessible environment. There is widespread scientific evidence to suggest, on the other hand, that locations in Texas -- some of which receive less than 12 inches of rainfall a year, a region where the groundwater table is more than 700 feet below the surface -- is a far better location for this waste. This is not a political assertion, it is a geological and environmental reality. A video clip of his comments can be viewed here . Congress passed the resolution comfortably by 305 votes to 117, as did the Senate , by 78 votes to 15. The proposal had much stronger support among Republicans than among Democrats. GOP members of the House voted 197-26 in favor, while Democrats were more evenly split, voting 107-91 in favor. In the Senate, not a single Republican opposed H.R. 629, while 51 of them voted for it. Fifteen Democratic Senators opposed the bill, while 27 of them voted in support. At that time, five out six Senators from Texas, Vermont, and Maine were Republicans. All five of them voted in favor of the proposal. Both of Maine's Representatives voted for the disposal site, as did 10 out of the 13 Republican Congress members from Texas. In the House, the proposal had 23 co-sponsors. Eleven were Republicans, eleven were Democrats, and one was Sanders himself, an Independent. The author of the resolution was Joe Barton, a Republican from Texas. Despite Congressional approval for the agreement, authorities in Texas ultimately rejected the proposal to establish a disposal site at Sierra Blanca. In October 1998, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission voted 3-0 against issuing a permit for the construction of a nuclear waste dump there. According to the Associated Press , commission chairman Barry McBee said the disposal site could have provided a much-needed economic boost to the area, but commission members were sufficiently concerned about safety issues to deny the permit. According to a September 1998 article in the Texas Observer , a group of activists opposed to the Sierra Blanca waste site approached Sanders at an anti-nuclear weapons rally in Vermont that year: Sanders left the stage, which surprised no one in the small Texas delegation. Earlier, he had told them, ""My position is unchanged, and you're not gonna like it."" When they asked if they would visit the site in Sierra Blanca, he said, ""Absolutely not. I'm gonna be running for re-election in the state of Vermont."" We contacted Bill Addison, a leading opponent of the Sierra Blanca proposal, who was identified in the Texas Tribune article as having attended that Springfield rally. He confirmed that he was present and corroborated the article's account of the activists' interaction with Sanders. We asked a spokesperson for Sanders whether he agrees that this exchange took place, but we did not receive a response to that specific question. Instead, the spokesperson offered a broader explanation and defense of the Senator's support of H.R. 629: The only reason Senator Sanders was ever involved is because the constitution requires Congress to approve interstate compacts. Texas Representative Joe Barton introduced such legislation in 1998, and twenty-three members of the Vermont, Texas and Maine congressional delegations cosponsored it. The bill did not endorse a specific site — in fact, it did not mention Sierra Blanca at all. Nor did the bill override the local and state approval process. In the end, the Texas agency in charge of permitting ruled against the Sierra Blanca site, choosing another site in Texas instead.  So, the process worked. The compact, much less the site selection were never Sen. Sanders’ idea.  He disagrees with the very premise of the 1980 law that led to the Texas-Vermont-Maine compact, since it put the burden of disposing of low-level waste on the states, rather the nuclear energy companies that produced much of the waste. In fact, he has long been an opponent of nuclear power precisely it produces waste for which we still have no solution (the Texas site is just for low-level contamination — there is still no plan for all of the high-level nuclear waste all across the country). Sanders' spokesperson is right to point out that the text of H.R. 629 did not mention Sierra Blanca, but the town was widely known and discussed as the proposed location of the disposal site throughout the time that Sanders and others supported the bill.  For example, in April 1998 (three months before Sanders and others in the House voted in favor of H.R. 629) the late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone condemned the proposed Sierra Blanca site from the floor of the Senate: What has troubled me from the very beginning is that this legislation would result in the dumping of low-level radioactive waste in a small, poor, majority-Latino community in rural West Texas — a town called Sierra Blanca. The Texas legislation in 1991 identified the area where the dump will be located. The Texas Waste Authority designated the site near Sierra Blanca in 1992. A draft license was issued in 1996. Whether we like it or not, this knowledge makes us responsible for what happens to Sierra Blanca. The Turning Point USA meme is accurate in claiming that Sanders supported and co-sponsored a proposal that would have seen nuclear waste from Maine, Vermont and (principally) Texas disposed of at a site in Sierra Blanca, and that Sierra Blanca was (and still is) a predominately Latino and relatively poor community. The meme leaves out important and relevant context by failing to mention the key role that Republicans played in crafting and passing that proposal; instead, it singles out Sanders and does not offer the reader any inkling of his environmentalist rationale. Sanders stood to gain politically from supporting a plan that would remove nuclear waste from his constituency, but this does not necessarily mean he wasn't motivated by a sincere desire to dispose of the waste in a manner and location that he genuinely believed to be safer. However, whether or not you believe his stated rationale was sincere, no proper analysis of a particular politician's policy position or Congressional vote should leave out the reasons put forward by that politician. Finally, we were not able to corroborate the ""Absolutely not"" quotation attributed to Sanders, and his spokesperson did not address our question about it.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1918
8d125e88-ebf3-4877-8c84-6928c7666b46,"A village just north of Chicago, Illinois, began garnering media attention in April 2018 for an ordinance passed by local leaders banning high-capacity firearms and magazines, with hefty fines for violators. The ban, which was passed by the Deerfield village board on 2 April 2018, applies to assault weapons only, which are defined in the ordinance as ""a semiautomatic rifle, pistol, or shotgun that has the capacity to accept more than ten rounds of ammunition plus another feature(s) defined in the ordinance."" The list of weapons covered under the ordinance includes AR-15 rifles, which have been used to commit several mass shootings around the United States, including the February 2018 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida in which a gunman killed seventeen people,  spurring a series of protests around the world . However, a Lake County Circuit Court judge issued a temporary restraining order on 12 June 2018 preventing the measure from being enforced, a day before it was slated to take effect. The measure includes fines of ""no less than $250 and not more than $1,000"" per day for people found to be in violation of the ordinance. However, village employees as well as law enforcement officers and ""the organized militia of this or any other state"" are exempt from having to abide by it. Owners of ""antique firearms manufactured in or before 1898"" are also exempt if their weapons are safely stored or displayed. The village, which is located around 25 miles from Chicago, also released a statement addressing questions about the ordinance, including how it will be enforced: Weapons being illegally possessed will be confiscated as authorized by the ordinance. Any other enforcement of this ordinance, including search or seizure to effect this ordinance, must comply with the requirements of State and Federal law. Members of the Department will not go ""door to door"" to ensure compliance. The ban was passed unanimously by the village's board of trustees. Two days later, the Institute for Legislative Action — the lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association — announced that they would support a lawsuit filed by another group, Guns Save Life, challenging the ordinance. At this moment a court hearing is scheduled for 8 June 2018, with gun advocacy groups seeking a temporary restraining order to halt enforcement of the ban: Gun-rights advocacy groups are asking a Lake County Circuit Court judge to bar the village of Deerfield from enforcing its ban on assault weapons that is set to kick in June 13. The ordinance enacted April 2 by the Deerfield Village Board gives residents until June 13 to turn in any guns that fit the village’s definition of assault weapons, remove them from the village or modify the guns so they’re no longer considered assault weapons. The ordinance empowers the town’s police chief to confiscate the assault weapons of anyone charged under the ordinance. Two lawsuits were filed in April challenging the ordinance on various grounds, including a claim that the ordinance deprives gun owners of property they are legally entitled to possess. The plaintiffs in both lawsuits are asking for a temporary restraining order to block Deerfield from enforcing the ban until the court can hear their arguments for a permanent injunction. A hearing to consider the restraining order motions is set for June 8, just days before the ban is set to take effect. The Deerville measure was reportedly based on a similar ordinance passed in another suburb, Highland Park, in 2013. That ordinance was upheld by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and in December 2015 the Supreme Court opted not to take up a case challenging the appeals court's decision.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,682
d558a072-67a7-415e-9d44-a9dcfa4f7d08,"On 3 May 2018, the ""Occupy Democrats"" Facebook page posted a meme which claimed that the president had violated the constitutional separation of church and state by setting up a ""religious office"": President Trump did sign an executive order in May 2018 to establish a new faith-based initiative within the White House, but nobody from his administration called it a ""religious office"" — that description appears to have come from Occupy Democrats. Furthermore, Trump's initiative represents significant continuity of, rather than a departure from, the previous two administrations. Although every detail and working of the new initiative has not yet been outlined, it certainly does not represent a radical change. Trump's White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative bears a striking resemblance to the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, which George W. Bush set up in 2001, and which Barack Obama continued during his administration but renamed the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. In brief, Trump's executive order — which he signed on 3 May 2018, the National Day of Prayer — replaces the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships with the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative, keeping it within the Executive Office of the President of the United States. The executive order also sets out the following: The initiative will be led by an Advisor to the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative, based out of the Office of Public Liaison. The executive order abolishes Obama's Advisory Council for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships Beyond that, Trump's order is somewhat vague on the exact workings of the initiative and the duties of the advisor who will lead it: The initiative will consult with ""experts and faith and various faith and community leaders"" with an interest in poverty, religious freedom, education, crime prevention, ""strengthening marriage and family,"" and other issues The advisor will give the president recommendations about policy relating to the services provided by faith-based and community organizations. One potentially significant provision in the executive order calls for those in charge of the Faith and Opportunity Initiative to contact the Attorney General if they see potential executive branch violations of a religious liberty memorandum published by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October 2017. The Sessions memorandum reiterated the positions set out by Trump in an earlier executive order , in which the President wrote: It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce Federal law’s robust protections for religious freedom.... All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, to the greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by law, respect and protect the freedom of persons and organizations to engage in religious and political speech. President Trump has prioritized enhancing legal protections for religious freedom, including when it comes to obligations placed on faith-based organizations that receive federal funding, the freedom of employers and employees to abstain from practices (particularly in health care) which they feel compromise their religious beliefs, and in calling for an end to the Johnson Amendment, a long-standing provision that bars religious 501 (c)(3) non-profit groups from engaging in electoral activism. In his 2001 executive order establishing the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, President George W. Bush emphasized that a driving force behind the policy was a desire to ""level the playing field"" in the disbursement of federal funding, and enhance the funding opportunities available for religious non-profit organizations — especially those focused on poverty, addiction, crime and other social issues: The paramount goal is compassionate results, and private and charitable community groups, including religious ones, should have the fullest opportunity permitted by law to compete on a level playing field, so long as they achieve valid public purposes, such as curbing crime, conquering addiction, strengthening families and neighborhoods, and overcoming poverty. This delivery of social services must be results oriented and should value the bedrock principles of pluralism, nondiscrimination, evenhandedness, and neutrality. The Occupy Democrats meme is largely accurate. In May 2018, Trump did indeed establish an initiative within the White House which would give faith-based organizations what the administration called a ""voice in the White House."" However, the description of the initiative as a ""religious office"" did not come from the Trump administration itself, and that is not its official name. Furthermore, Trump's 2018 initiative represents significant continuity from predecessor offices set up by George W. Bush in 2001 and Barack Obama in 2009, although the exact focus, workings, and influence of Trump's initiative remain to be seen. On 5 May, the ""Being Liberal"" Facebook page and web site published an article with the headline ""Trump quietly signed an Executive Order allowing government to fund religious groups."" This is very misleading, and ignores the fact that the federal government has been providing grants, funding and tax write-offs to religious non-profit organizations for many years, including during the Obama administration. Trump's creation of the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative did not usher in that state of affairs.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,939

343f076d-5a94-409e-9821-a1d536223ef6,"Immigration is a sensitive and touchy issue, and never more so than in the United States during an election year.  Thus, when stories started to emerge in 2016 about a group of veterans of the U.S. military living in Mexico after they had been deported from the United States (a story we previously reported on) it seemed natural to question what looked like nothing more than a chunk of political kryptonite. However, deported veterans exist , although no one — not even the Department of Homeland Security — knows how many .  Their issue has been slowly brought into mainstream American consciousness largely by the efforts of committed activists in Tijuana. "" The Bunker ,"" also known as the Deported Veterans Support House, is in a small cinderbrick building tucked away on a side street in Mexico's border town of Tijuana, and is frequented by veterans of every branch of the United States military, who fought everywhere from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Former Army paratrooper Hector Barajas, 39, opened it to be a gathering place and a refuge for veterans who, like him, had been deported : ""I started The Bunker because there was a need,"" Barajas told us. He said since his deportation, he had been meeting others like him living in Tijuana, and discovered that they lived throughout Mexico — but not just Mexico.  There are hundreds of deported military vets living in at least twenty countries, he said. Since then, The Bunker has since become less a refuge and more a cause: Our vision is to end the deportations of Deported Veterans, repatriate the ones who have already been deported, and offer support until they all go home. We shouldn't honor our Deported Veterans by allowing them to return upon death. Honor them by allowing them to return home to their families and give them any benefits that they are eligible for. It may come as a surprise to learn that serving in the United States military does not automatically confer citizenship , but it doesn't.  It can smooth the way, provided the aspiring citizen is aware of what they need to do in order to apply for citizenship and gets it done within a certain timeframe . However, it's not uncommon for enlistees to wrongly assume (having never been told otherwise) they have done all they need to do in order to be awarded citizenship, and thus all they have to do after their honorable discharge is wait. Sometimes, too, there are bureaucratic foulups. One man was deported after he was unable to attend a hearing, despite his reason: he was in the hospital receiving surgery at the time.  Others do everything the way they're supposed to, filing their paperwork and appearing at their meetings, but still get deported, and no one seems to know exactly why.  Once they are outside the U.S., they maintain a legal right to VA benefits such as healthcare, and to whatever funds they might be entitled, but they have no way of getting back into the United States to obtain that assistance, and there are no satellite offices outside the country to help them. Because these particular veterans are either in the United States on green cards or without documentation after their discharges, they can be deported with cause, or for no reason at all.  Past and present members of the armed forces are supposed to receive special consideration during deportation hearings, but the guidelines are inconsistently applied. However, some of these veterans have spent time in prison for assault or drug offenses, which makes their situation more difficult to parse, at least politically.  Elected officials (and candidates) who might ordinarily be in full-throated cry about the importance of military rights tend to go oddly silent when confronted with the spectres of undocumented soldiers.  Sympathy for those wounded on the battlefield under the American flag suddenly falters when it turns out they had entered the country without documentation years before. Miguel Perez, a United States Army veteran, falls under that category. The 39-year-old Illinois man, who served two tours in Afghanistan and who has been in the U.S. since he was eight, was convicted of a drug trafficking offense in 2008. The green card holder had served half of a 15-year prison sentence when Immigration, Customs, and Enforcement took him for deportation proceedings. After losing an appeal, Perez was deported in March 2018: Perez was flown from Gary, Indiana, to Brownsville, Texas, where officers escorted him across the border and turned him over to Mexican authorities, ICE officials said. Perez appeared shocked by his treatment during his final moments on U.S. soil. An ICE agent who described himself as a fellow veteran told Perez they would ""fix this"" while leading him to a gate, Perez said. ""When we go there he just closed the gate behind me and he said, 'OK, we're done here,'"" he said. ""He said, 'You see those green lights? You go that way and when you get there just ask for help.'"" Perez recalls thinking, ""Really? This is it?"" The veteran said he immediately contemplated suicide but then said he felt he needed to keep walking and continue the fight to let others know how he and other undocumented veterans are treated by the U.S. Unless something changes for them, the only way most of the deported veterans will be able to return to the United States is by dying. By law, all military veterans (except those who have been dishonorably discharged) are entitled to burial in a national cemetery, and immigration laws don't apply to corpses. On 20 April 2016, lawmakers introduced a bill to readmit military veterans who were deported and who were not previously convicted of serious crimes. It would also prevent the removal of military veterans from the U.S. in the future. On 13 April 2018, Hector Barajas, the deported veteran who was one of the first to shine a spotlight on their plight, received his American citizenship, potentially paving the way for hundreds of other former United States military members:",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1138

The event was organized by activist group Avaaz , which put out a press release clarifying the number (7,000) as well as the manner of death (all gun violence among people under the age of 18): MEDIA ADVISORY— Tuesday March 13, from 8:30am, near the US Capitol: Shoes Memorial to 7,000 kids killed by guns in the US since the Sandy Hook school massacre / More details and contacts here: https://t.co/QP7eEQuyNe #NeverAgain #NotOneMore Follow @Avaaz_News for updates pic.twitter.com/2Q9qY8MtxM — Avaaz (@Avaaz) March 11, 2018 According to a press release issued in advance of the event, the figure of 7,000 came from the Centers for Disease Control. No link to any supporting information was included, but Avaaz said that guns kill more than ""1,300 American kids a year."" Approximately five years and three months passed between the Sandy Hook shooting and the demonstration; in that period of time by those figures, the number of children killed by guns would be roughly 6,825. Using the CDC's database search tool , we were unable to arrive at precisely the same numbers due to the way such information is catalogued and presented. The parameters available were slightly different, and we were able to access statistics for every recorded death of an individual under the age of 18 for the years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 (the system does not yet have data for 2017). The four-year tally for all firearm deaths in that truncated period was 5,683, which per year broke down slightly higher at 1,421 firearm deaths on average among those under the age of 18. When extrapolated to the five-year, three-month period the empty shoes protest encompasses, the number is closer to 7,460. We contacted Avaaz to ask about the source of their numbers, and they replied: We arrived at the number based on CDC estimates of ~1300 kids killed by guns a year (a number the CDC calls conservative). Since the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Dec 2012 until now, the math shakes out to roughly 7000 kids (0-17) killed by guns since then. The demonstration was genuine and took place on 13 March 2018. Variations: On 16 March 2018, an initiative published by the American Association of Pediatrics (AAP)'s AAP News reiterated CDC statistics indicating 1,300 children in the United States died of gunfire on average each year. A Newsweek article published that day contrasted the number of children killed by guns per year with the number of soldiers killed in all campaigns since 11 September 2001: MORE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN KILLED BY GUNS SINCE SANDY HOOK THAN U.S. SOLDIERS IN COMBAT SINCE 9/11 The number of children killed by gunfire in the U.S. since the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, surpasses the total of American soldiers killed in overseas combat since 9/11, according to a Department of Defense report. The report accounts for total deaths in the five military operations since the war on terror began following the September 11, 2001 attacks through 10 a.m. EST Thursday, March 15. Over 17 years of combat, the U.S. has lost 6,929 soldiers. Including Department of Defense civilians killed overseas, that number grows to 6,950. Concurrently, a Facebook meme circulated providing similar (but not identical) figures: Using the above-provided estimate of 7,460 deaths of children since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for comparison, the Newsweek item held that Department of Defense statistics showed fewer American soldiers died in wars since 9/11 than American children cited in the original estimate. A Department of Defense document did not measure the two against one another, but it did provide the total number of war-related deaths in five separate campaigns after 11 September 2001 [ PDF , archived ]. According to that document updated on 23 March 2018, casualties both in combat and those classed as ""non-hostile"" were listed as follows: Operation Iraqi Freedom: 4,424 Operation New Dawn: 73 Operation Enduring Freedom: 2,350 Operation Inherent Resolve: 61 Operation Freedom's Sentinel: 49 The number of American soldiers killed in all campaigns combined following 9/11 totaled 6,957.

9c3591f6-82e0-4d03-9eab-d05126555cfc,"On 26 January 2018, a Connecticut woman posted video to her Facebook page that was apparently video from a hidden camera showing California high school teacher Gregory Salcido talking pejoratively about the U.S. military: Flauto, a family friend of the student who shot the footage, asked Facebook friends to ""make this go viral"" —and they heeded her request. The videos have been viewed millions of times and shared thousands of times. Salcido's comments captured headlines in local and national publications and were blasted by right-wing outlets . Salcido is both a long-time teacher at El Rancho High School and a city councilman in Pico Rivera, a working-class city of roughly 63,000 in southeast Los Angeles County. When we contacted him, he declined to comment. In the videos, which were secretly recorded by senior Victor Quinonez, Salcido's comments were often met with students' laughter. He criticizes military recruitment on the high school's campus and derides the glorification of the military, saying statements made by United States President Donald Trump about the its greatness are overblown. In the quote that drew the most outrage, Salcido said: We got all our freaking night vision goggles, all that kind of stuff, and we can't freaking control these dudes wearing freaking robes and chanclas . Because we got a bunch of dumb shits over there. Think about the people who you know who are over there, your freaking stupid Uncle Louie or whoever, they're dumb shits. They're not like high-level thinkers, they're not academic people, they're not intellectual people. They're the freaking lowest of our low. Not morally. I'm not saying they make bad moral decisions. They're not talented people. [...] How come when you go to like the Rose Bowl, Rose Parade, Dodger opening day, why after the national anthem do we have a killing machine fly over the freaking stadium? You know the stealth bomber's out there and everyone's like, ""Yeah that's what we kill people with!"" Like why would that be something we celebrate? I don't get it. Anyway, you better not freaking go. The comments drew a rather intense round of what has become a familiar pattern of viral Internet outrage and backlash. In response to the controversy, Salcido has been officially admonished by the Pico Rivera City Council and stripped of his committee assignments. He has been placed on leave by the El Rancho Unified School District while the incident is under scrutiny. Even the United States Department of Defense has weighed in, calling Salcido's comments "" uninformed ."" Salcido told the Los Angeles Times he was receiving ""vulgar and violent threats"" directed against himself and his family. Pico Rivera is a tight-knit, primarily Latino suburb that has a strong tradition of honoring veterans and a large military-serving community, with two Veterans of Foreign Wars posts and two American Legion auxiliaries, said Mayor Gustavo Camacho. Speaking by phone, Camacho told us: I respect the First Amendment and freedom of speech and Mr. Salcido is entitled to his freedom of speech. But I want to remind him that the reason he has that freedom is because of the men and women who lost their lives in order for us to have that freedom of speech. Many folks can listen to an audio and interpret it as they see fit. If you have an opinion about recruitment or a particular college recruiter, why don’t we tell our kids, ""These are our options. I think this is a better option and let me help you get there,"" rather than saying they're dumb shits. I and my fellow council members strongly disagree with Mr. Salcido's statements and viewpoints. Frankly we denounce those statements. But Trinity College sociology professor and U.S. Army veteran Johnny Eric Williams said although Salcido's comments were delivered clumsily, the teacher shouldn't be formally punished for making them, calling the response troubling and overblown. Williams himself was the subject of a separate Internet outrage storm in June 2017, when a post on his personal Facebook page intended to criticize structural racism and white supremacy went viral after right-wing web sites interpreted it as racist toward white people. Williams, who is African-American, received death threats and told us that he continues to get them to this day. He added: The classroom is your social space where people can say things they wouldn’t say normally out of the classroom setting so they can seriously interrogate it. It sounds like he was trying to provoke the kids to think about why a student would wear a Marines shirt without thinking about what the Marines do. Clearly it didn’t come across well, but it’s a classroom setting. He’s not doing a major speech, he’s trying to get kids to think about what the role of the military is. It’s not simply to protect freedom, as they say generically. The question is, freedom to do what and whose freedoms? That’s the question that should be asked. Why would a kid record a teacher like that in the first place without him knowing? I think that’s a level of cowardice and of unwillingness to participate that is unfathomable to me. It was done with malice. All education is about integrating people into what it means to be an American. One of the most important things is to be someone who questions, who thinks critically and dissents. That’s the most patriotic thing someone can do. Williams told us that as a veteran, he found Salcido's comments about the intelligence of service members to be unfounded and an excellent example of intellectual elitism: What happens is the U.S. military is the last option for folks in rural and poverty-stricken areas. There’s no other opportunity for them. But the idea that these folks are not smart, I don’t agree with that at all. That’s how I got through college. I had to do it because I didn’t have money. That’s why you have a voluntary army, because these people have nothing else they can do. Then they go and die while the kids with money go to college and don’t even think about the fact that we’re in eternal war. Nevertheless, Williams cautioned that lacking the freedom to criticize the military is akin to fascism. He added: At this historical moment in time, people are more interested in how something is said, rather than what is said and what it means. Quinonez told local news station KTLA he recorded Salcido because he wants to join the Marine Corps and was tired of the teacher's negative commentary on the military. Pico Rivera is a thriving community with a growing economy, but it's no stranger to cut-throat politics and controversy — and neither is Salcido. However, much of the controversy in the city's past has been contained to the local level. In 2010, he ignited debate when he took the helm in the city's rotating mayoral position, then removed a Bible from the Council chamber's dais and put a halt to invocation, saying it was unconstitutional. He was also placed on administrative leave by the school district that year after admonishing a student to be quiet by saying, ""Shut up, Kelly, before I kill you."" Salcido said at the time the comment was purposefully over-the-top and intended in jest. The child's parent, Gerald Kelly, said he was angry because Salcido was talking about marriage equality for LGBTQ people, criticizing organized religion, and (again) speaking critically of the military in class: This is the mayor and he’s out here destroying these kids’ minds. Why allow him to lead this city when he stands for non-religious beliefs and that it’s OK to be against the Bible, [says it’s OK to be] homosexual and defames people in the military? Salcido has clashed with his peers on the city council in the past as well, often as their vocal critic amid allegations of public corruption . Although Salcido has faced widespread criticism for his remarks, he has historically been a popular teacher with students. Some of his current and former students have come to his defense, averring that the teacher also promised to fully support a student if he decided to join the military in spite of Salcido's discouragement. (This purported gesture of reassurance was not shown in the videos.) More generally, students have described Salcido as "" real ,"" "" inspiring "" and "" loved ."" One of Salcido's current students, a senior at El Rancho High School, spoke to us anonymously. (We have verified the student's identity.) That student described Salcido as a teacher who ""cares greatly about his students' success"" but deliberately provokes debate in his classes and encourages his students to have ""deep conversations."" The student also told us that Salcido ""sometimes has a very sarcastic sense of humor, and sometimes it may be taken the wrong way,"" but offered the opinion that the teacher was expressing his ""genuine beliefs"" in the video clips: Not a lot of teachers can keep their students captivated as much as he can. He really is one of a kind. He likes to get us thinking and he genuinely cares about what the students think... He's one of those guys that you would be happy to see every day and a person to always make you laugh. On 20 March 2018, the El Rancho Unified School District Board voted to terminate Salcido's employment as a teacher at El Rancho High School. As reported by the Whittier Daily News , Salcido has one month in which he can appeal the decision, during which time he will remain on unpaid leave.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1850
992eb658-0cd6-491d-af2f-f3528c34d660,"In mid-March 2018, readers began to ask whether it was true that Toys R Us locations had stopped accepting gift cards as a form of payment as of 11 March 2018: is it true toy retailer, Toys R Us is no longer accepting gift cards after 3/11/18? Many linked to a 10 March 2018 Scotsman.com article about a similar situation, but it focused on Toys R Us locations specifically in the United Kingdom: Toys R Us have said on their website: “Gift cards and vouchers will be honoured until Sunday, 11 March [2018]. There are no refunds for cash value on any gift cards. “But customers are encouraged to redeem such vouchers as soon as possible as stores may be subject to closure without notice.” News about UK-based locations proved confusing to some readers, and the gift card announcement coincided with matters related to Toys R Us' fiscal solvency in the United States. A post shared to shopping site SlickDeals in March 2018 posited that those in possession of Toys R Us gift cards ought to use them sooner rather than later: Multiple reports are out there that TRU is going into liquidation bankruptcy next week. If you have gift cards, they'll be trash the moment they announce, most likely. Use those cards this weekend if you don't want them to be worthless. Hold onto receipts if they manage to avoid liquidation, you can just return the items if you didn't have anything much you wanted right now. If not, at least you got something for your paper. Also remember to check your rewards total and use those points/certificates as well! The post referenced a 9 March 2018 CNNMoney article about the closure of UK-based Toys R Us locations, and the state of the retailer's finances in the United States. On 13 March 2018, CNBC cited reports of a liquidation plan in progress: Toys R Us, the iconic U.S. retailer, is in the process of drafting the court motion for its liquidation plan, a source familiar with the situation told CNBC on [13 March 2018]. The retailer could file as soon as the end of [14 March 2018], making the motion official. It will then begin to wind down the storied toy retailer, after more than half a century in business. A liquidation will most likely result in the closing of all of Toys R Us' 800 stores in the U.S. As of midday on 14 March 2018 the web site ToysRUs.com still accepted gift cards as payment, and the site offered customers the option of purchasing physical or virtual versions at checkout: Although articles speculated that Toys R Us gift cards might soon become worthless in the United States, and UK outlets have stopped accepting them, no definitive information about their future is yet available. In response to our inquiry, a representative for Toys R Us replied: Thanks for asking! Please know that we are not going out of business, but we are making changes to the number of stores we have. In the meantime, our stores are operating as usual and you can also continue to shop online at https://www.toysrus.com and https://www.babiesrus.com. Additionally, our customer registry, credit, warranty and loyalty programs will continue as normal. We will also continue to sell and accept gift cards as always. On 15 March 2018, a representative for Toys R Us said the chain planned to honor gift cards for a 30-day period. However, the Better Business Bureau advised consumers to use the cards ""sooner rather than later.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,663
881356e2-9d31-4fe4-ac69-c206e0cb516b,"On 15 November 2017, several news organizations reported that President Donald Trump had reversed Obama-era conservation efforts involving the import of ivory from Zimbabwe and Zambia, sparking outrage among animal rights supporters.  CNN attributed the regulatory change to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: US authorities will remove restrictions on importing African elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia. That means Americans will soon be able to hunt the endangered big game, an activity that garnered worldwide attention when a Minnesota dentist took Cecil, perhaps the world's most famous lion, near a wildlife park in Zimbabwe. A US Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman said the move will allow the two African countries to include US sport hunting as part of their management plans for the elephants and allow them to put ""much-needed revenue back into conservation."" Critics, however, note the restrictions were created by the Obama administration in 2014 because the African elephant population had dropped. The animals are listed in the US Endangered Species Act, which requires the US government to protect endangered species in other countries. The 2014 restriction on importing elephant trophies included those that were hunted legally in Zimbabwe and Zambia.  However, a provision of the Endangered Species Act allows for restricted activities such as the import of animal trophies if they are undertaken ""to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected species."" In order to fulfill its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the United States restricts the number of legally-hunted elephant trophies to two per year. Safari Club International, a hunting advocacy group that filed a lawsuit challenging the 2014 restriction, first announced the regulation change on their web site. In November 2017, a spokesperson for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service confirmed the change to the 2914 regulations and explained the rationale behind it: Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve those species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the hunting and management programs for African elephants in Zimbabwe and Zambia will enhance the survival of the species in the wild. These enhancement findings are required prior to allowing import of these trophies under Endangered Species Act regulations. The finding applies to elephants hunted in Zimbabwe on or after January 21, 2016, and on or before December 31, 2018, and to elephants hunted in Zambia during calendar years 2016, 2017 and 2018, for applications that meet all other applicable permitting requirements. On 17 November 2017, the Trump administration announced that it would place a "" hold "" on reversing the ban, pending further review, and a few days later President Trump tweeted about the issue: Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017 However, the President appeared to have been at odds with others in his administration over this issue, as NPR reported in March 2018: ""I didn't want elephants killed and stuffed and have the tusks brought back into this [country]. And people can talk all they want about preservation and all other things that they're saying,"" [Trump] told British broadcaster Piers Morgan , referring to the argument proffered by his own interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, and others that fees paid by big-game hunters could help fund conservation programs. ""In that case, the money was going to a government that was probably taking the money, OK?"" ""That was done by a very high-level government person,"" he added in reference to the agency's decision. ""As soon as I heard about it, I turned it around."" But Trump appears to have lost that battle in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which in December 2017 ruled in a case brought by the National Rifle Association and Safari Club International  that the Obama-era regulations had been improperly implemented Among other aspects, the two organizations challenged the Endangered Species Act [ESA] findings on which the regulation was based and argued that the Fish and Wildlife Service ""impermissibly relied on standards that are more stringent than the statutory requirements in the ESA."" That ruling already appears to have affected a number of other endangered species trophies. The Fish and Wildlife Service released a memo on 1 March 2018 in response to the ruling, withdrawing Endangered Species Act findings from various years for trophies of elephants from Zimbabwe, Tanzania, South Africa, and Namibia; lions from Zimbabwe and South Africa; and bontebok in South Africa; and stating that applications would be considered on an individual basis: However, the Service intends to use the information cited in these findings and contained in its files as appropriate, in addition to the information it receives and has available when it receives each application, to evaluate individual permit applications. The Fish and Wildlife Service will now review permits on a case-by-case basis. The agency did not announce this change, however, and the memo only began receiving media attention when The Hill and other news outlets reported on it in March 2018.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,988
a4eb5dd2-67e2-4a0f-8342-9f657b3e2a72,"One aspect of President Donald Trump's proposed federal budget for the 2018 fiscal year has come under criticism for its potential effect on low-income seniors, particularly during winter months in colder parts of the U.S. The president's proposed budget eliminated funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which assists people who need help paying their energy bills. According to a ""budget blueprint"" released by the Office of Budget and Management (OMB): Compared to other income support programs that serve similar populations, LIHEAP is a lower-impact program and is unable to demonstrate strong performance outcomes. During the 2016-17 fiscal year, LIHEAP reportedly distributed $3.4 billion in aid to around 6 million households. Lawmakers in cold-weather states have consistently opposed cuts. On 15 February 2017—before Trump's administration first announced its proposed budget—Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) were part of a bipartisan group of 45 senators who sent a letter to both the president and OMB calling for ""robust funding"" for the program in 2016. They said: More than 90 percent of LIHEAP recipients have at least one household member who is a child, elderly, or disabled, and the percentage of households with at least one veteran has grown to 20 percent. The program helps to ensure that eligible recipients do not have to choose between paying their energy bills and affording other necessities like food and medicine. Following the release of the proposal in May 2017, independent Maine Sen. Angus King—a member of the Senate Budget Committee—said in a statement: Many of the reductions proposed in this budget – from the cuts to Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to LIHEAP – will hammer thousands of people across Maine, including older, disabled, and lower-income people. Hard working Maine people who pay taxes expect a government that works for them, but they are the ones who will suffer when the tax cuts proposed in this budget directly benefit those who need it least. Trump's proposal was rejected by both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, each of which allocated $3.39 billion toward LIHEAP for fiscal year 2018, consistent with the initiative's funding for the previous fiscal year. On 8 September 2017, the president signed House Resolution 601 into law, enabling the release of $3.03 billion in LIHEAP funding, good for 90 percent of what both committees allocated. A Senate aide confirmed to us that the release of that money will allow the program to run into calendar year 2018. However, the Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal year 2019 once again calls for LIHEAP to be scuttled.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,491
d81a6988-e17e-4ebe-a31f-183029d81357,"On 16 November 2017, under the leadership of House Speaker Paul Ryan, the United States House of Representatives passed their version of what would later become the sweeping GOP tax reform bill of 2017. Thirteen days later, Charles and Elizabeth Koch donated $247,000 apiece to Paul Ryan’s fundraising campaign, ""Team Ryan,"" according to filings published by investigative journalism outfit ProPublica. ""Team Ryan"" is not a single campaign fund but rather a joint-fundraising committee that raises money for Paul Ryan’s re-election fund (Ryan for Congress), the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), and Paul Ryan's leadership PAC named Prosperity Action. Because of that factor, it is important to be precise about where money given to ""Team Ryan"" is actually going. Columbia Law School professor and government ethics expert Richard Briffault told us that only a portion of those donations would benefit Ryan directly, making the contributions ""less a reward for Ryan personally"" and more of a win for House Republicans generally: Most of the money cannot have gone to Ryan's campaign committee — the most that committee could legally receive is $10,800 — $5400 from each of the husband and wife Kochs. Each could also give $237,000 (or $474,000 for the two of them) — the maximum allowable — to the NRCC — the Congressional Campaign arm of the Republican party, presumably to be used in races other than, or in addition to, Ryan's own. The remainder appears to have gone to Prosperity Action, Ryan's Leadership PAC — probably $5000 from each of them. The Leadership PAC can only give to other candidates. The Koch donations have raised eyebrows, given the financial benefit that the Kochs and their business ventures would seemingly enjoy under the new tax plan. Adam Smith, communications director at campaign finance reform nonprofit Every Voice, told the International Business Times (IBT) that: Republicans never hid the fact that this tax bill was about pleasing their big donors. And it looks like House Speaker [Paul] Ryan is quickly being rewarded for passing this legislation that overwhelmingly benefits the Kochs and billionaires like them. Richard Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, co-director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and a Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota Law School, concurs. He told us via e-mail that this seemed ""pretty close to an illegal gratuity ,"" which in this case would be a payment as thanks for an official action, a lesser but related offense to bribery, according to the Department of Justice . Casting aside the massive grey area within the interpretation of laws pertaining to political fundraising, we note it is equally important to point out that the Kochs were far from the only ones to participate in similar political giving activity. Six other $100,000 donations were made to Team Ryan after the passage of the bill, according to the IBT: [The Koch] donations were by far the largest sums added to Ryan’s coffers in the fourth quarter of 2017, but they were by no means the only major contributions: Marlene Ricketts, the wife of billionaire TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, donated $100,000, as did five other individuals. When we asked Professor Briffault whether these donations were something to get worked up about or simply ""politics as usual,"" he told us that he rejected the premise of the question, suggesting instead that it could be both: ""I am tempted to suggest that you've made a false opposition — that this is both something to get worked up about and politics as usual,"" he wrote.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,692

But while it's true that at least one member of the group received one, it is unclear how many constituents at large have as well. A spokesperson for Cotton's office, Caroline Rabbitt Tabler, confirmed the existence of the letters, saying that they were issued ""under extreme circumstances."" She also said that it was rare to send any constituent such a letter. There has been no confirmed tally of how many times it has happened. The letters began getting attention when the liberal group Ozark Indivisible posted a picture of one on Twitter on 17 January 2018, along with a message taunting the senator: #TraitorTommy @TomCottonAR scared of his constituents calling so he's sending out cease and desist letters.

The letters themselves, however, are not recent; the one posted by Ozark Indivisible was dated 17 October 2017. A Fayetteville resident, Stacey Lane, identified herself as the recipient of the letter posted online. Rabbitt Tabler said Cotton's office did not accuse her of saying anything threatening but did not go into detail on why it sent her the letter. Ozark Indivisible confirmed to us on 19 January 2018 that Lane is a member of their organization. They also disputed reports that Lane threatened anyone or called a staffer a ""cunt."" The group added: There have been others who have received the letters, but they do not want to come forward. They are not OI members. According to reports, ""an unspecified number of individuals"" received letters that month. Rabbitt Tabler said in a statement that they are ""only used under extreme circumstances"": Senator Cotton is always happy to hear from Arkansans and encourages everyone to contact his offices to express their thoughts, concerns, and opinions. In order to maintain a safe work environment, if an employee of Senator Cotton receives repeated communications that are harassing and vulgar, or any communication that contains a threat, our policy is to notify the U.S. Capitol Police's Threat Assessment Section and, in accordance with their guidance, send a cease and desist letter to the individual making the harassing or threatening communication. Another person, who did not identify themselves, told the Arkansas Times that they received a similar letter. They said: I believe if Tom Cotton's office were to respond as to why they sent this letter, I think they just honestly don't want to listen to any citizen's opposing view or hear the numerous grave concerns U.S. citizens have about the serious & ongoing attack on our Democracy and past election cycle in which a foreign, hostile Russian government interfered, they don't want U.S. citizens to call and speak their mind and truth in a very direct manner and they obviously don't want to be held accountable for their words and actions while serving all the people in this nation. I may have used unprofessional and unbecoming language at times as the anxiety and stress of what I'm witnessing is at times too great a burden to control and I have vehemently expressed my righteous anger at Senator Cotton's complicitness with this harmful regime.

Why do we want all these people from Africa here? Why do we want all these people from shithole countries?"" The statement from Botswana said (in part): The Botswana Government has also enquired from the US Government through the Ambassador, to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a ""shithole"" country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US, and also that some of Botswana may wish to visit the US. The Government of Botswana is wondering why President Trump, must use this descriptor and derogatory word, when talking about countries with whom the US has had cordial and mutually beneficial bilateral relations for so many years. * Officials in Ghana, Haiti, Senegal, and South Africa have also reportedly called for meetings with U.S. diplomats because of the alleged comment. In a separate statement, the African Union, which represents all 55 countries on the continent, also condemned the reported remark and called for both a retraction and ""an apology not only to the Africans but to all people of African descent around the globe."" Trump, who opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by calling some Mexican immigrants ""rapists"" and ""criminals,"" reportedly made the remark during a meeting concerning a deal that would allow for increased security along the U.S.-Mexico border, while also allowing for the continuation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Around 700,000 people are currently enrolled in the DACA program, which allows enrollees to live and work in the U.S. for two-year periods. A federal judge ruled on 9 January 2018 that the Trump administration must accept renewal applications from enrollees. The president later said of his controversial remarks on Twitter that ""The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made — a big setback for DACA!""  He also specifically denied saying anything insulting about Haiti : Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country.

aed1ce48-278f-4a70-b8d7-d4a5a511d0af,"On 24 December 2017, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was scaling back an Obama-era policy that ramped up the use of fines on skilled nursing facilities for actions that endangered vulnerable patients: The Trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury, part of a broader relaxation of regulations under the president. The shift in the Medicare program’s penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry. The American Health Care Association, the industry’s main trade group, has complained that under President Barack Obama, federal inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve. As would be expected, the Times report (which was published on Christmas Eve) resulted in a number of aggregated stories crafted to play up the outrage angle with sensational headlines reporting, essentially, that the president was going to kill Grandma on Christmas. Over-the-top wording as in this headline, ""Trump Will Permit Abuse Of Elderly In Nursing Homes,"" prompted readers to inquire whether the story was true. Elder abuse is a crime , and that has not changed. However, the Trump administration did begin the process of rolling back an Obama administration policy that uses hefty fines as leverage against facilities that cause serious harm to patients. The Trump administration issued two Notices of Proposed Rule-Making (NPRMs) in May and June of 2017 which will reverse rules requiring the presence of a designated facility grievance officer to handle allegations of wrongdoing, and prohibiting nursing homes from requiring patients to sign pre-dispute arbitration agreements as a condition of admission. These changes do not mean that rampant, unchecked abuse will be allowed to take place, as some headlines have suggested however. In November 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also issued a moratorium on a requirement that nursing homes develop a baseline care plan for new patients within 48 hours of admission, along with seven other requirements on things like behavioral health care, psychotropic medication and facility assessments. The effects of the rollbacks are not yet known, but Toby Edelman, senior attorney for the Center for Medicare Advocacy, told the Times , ""They’ve pretty much emasculated enforcement, which was already weak."" According to federal records reviewed by the Times , four in every ten nursing homes have been cited at least once since 2013 for a serious violations such as neglect, mistreatment and failing to protect residents from accidents and bed sores. CMS put an 18-month moratorium on a requirement that nursing homes develop a basic care plan for new patients within 48 hours. This rule was put in place after the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found in a study published in 2014 that one in five Medicare patients experienced medical complications within an average 15 days of admission to nursing facilities, most of which were serious, preventable and resulted in millions in additional medical expenses billed to Medicare. However in a memo to state health departments, CMS noted that the moratorium does not mean violation of requirements will result in no enforcement. Requirements that fall under the purview of the moratorium, like the baseline care plan, will simply be handled differently until the end of the moratorium period. In a statement, Center for Medicare Advocacy policy attorney Dara Valanejad told us: The Center for Medicare Advocacy is greatly concerned by the Administration's actions rolling back the minimum standards of care set out in the Medicare and Medicaid Requirements of Participation. CMS should be protecting the rights of residents, who should be its primary focus, not referring to the nursing home industry as its “ customer .” The minimum nursing home standards were implemented because there was an unmet need for urgent resident protections. For example, the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reported in 2014 that one in five residents experienced harm within the first month of admission (the average was 15.5 days) to a skilled nursing facility, 20 percent of these cases resulted in life-sustaining interventions or death, and 59 percent of these adverse events were “clearly or likely preventable.” The Baseline Care Plan, one of the Phase 2 Requirements that CMS placed an 18-month moratorium on, requires nursing homes to develop a basic care plan within 48 hours to address the type of problems that the OIG found. How can nursing home residents and their families feel safe knowing that such vital requirements, meant to protect them from harm, injury, or death, will not be properly enforced? Per the Times report, the American Health Care Association sent a letter to then-President Elect Trump in December 2016 asking for ""relief"" from regulations and complained to CMS: Rather than spending quality time with their patients, the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and doesn’t increase the quality of care they provide.

2209f6db-6b06-4324-b94a-2e6f7de186f7,"Under current United States tax law, every flight sold by an “aircraft management company” to a passenger comes with a two-part tax on that passenger: a fee that is 7.5 percent of the value of the flight, as well as a flat dollar amount for each individual segment of a domestic flight. As written, there's a lack of clarity surrounding the question of whether the companies that maintain and staff private jets on behalf of a plane's private owner can be counted as an aircraft management company. If so, there's also the question of whether they would be required to tax their owner-passengers under this regulation. In March 2012, the IRS released a memo arguing that the rule does indeed apply in cases in which a company managing a plane for a private owner. This had the result of making such aircraft management companies potentially liable for years of back-taxes that would have been — but were not — levied on their passengers and/or aircraft owners. After significant lobbying, the IRS froze efforts to collect such taxes until after completing a review of the policy. In July 2017, the IRS announced that it would be shelving all pending audits relating to these “ticket taxes” on private aircraft management companies. As of its final markup by the Senate Committee on Finance, released on 15 November 2017, the Senate GOP-sponsored tax reform bill includes a provision that formalizes the IRS policy (it is not in the recently passed House version) of not applying this ticket tax to aircraft management companies servicing private jets: The proposal exempts certain payments related to the management of private aircraft from the excise taxes imposed on taxable transportation by air. Exempt payments are those amounts paid by an aircraft owner for management services related to maintenance and support of the owner’s aircraft or flights on the owner’s aircraft. This provision was included in the final version of the Senate Bill passed on 1 December 2017. The Senate's version of the law would have the effect of making explicit the de facto policy that transportation via private jet is not subject to the same taxes that passengers on commercial airlines incur. Critics of the bill suggest that, because the United States air traffic services are funded from these taxes, the non-private-jet-owning American public ends up essentially subsidizing the cost of air travel for the ultra-wealthy. As reported by Bloomberg in September 2017: On a per flight basis, a private jet could generate as little as two percent of the taxes and fees paid by airline passengers on an identical route, Bloomberg found in its review. High-performance private planes make up about 10 percent of U.S. flights under air-traffic control, yet pay less than 1 percent into a trust fund that finances air-traffic control and other Federal Aviation Administration operations, an agency study found this year. Supporters of the bill, which include Ohio Democrat senator and co-sponsor of legislation that inspired this measure Sherrod Brown, argue that it merely provides certainty to private aviation industry, which has acted without formal guidance for years. In a statement lauding the proposal, National Air Transportation Association President Martin H. Hiller said: Tax reform legislation has a long way to go, but this is an important step and small aviation businesses are appreciative of the inclusion of this provision, which provides them the tax certainty they have long sought. Because this provision is not literally a tax cut or deduction explicitly given to private-jet owners, but because it has the effect of reducing the tax burden of private-jet passengers relative to the commercial airline flying public, we rank the claim of a private jet tax cut in the senate GOP tax bill as mostly true. We note, however, that the bill in effect does nothing but codify a status quo.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,698

NBC is now reporting that Donald Trump’s campaign management has fallen under the scrutiny of an FBI inquiry, which is sure to blossom into a formal criminal investigation centered on Trump’s disgraced ex-manager Paul Manafort’s stewardship of the Republican campaign and his close ties to Ukraine. When he departed, Manafort was facing felony charges, and now the FBI’s suspicions have been confirmed by the evidence. New York Times found Ukrainian documents which outlined $12.7 million in previously unreported payments from a Ukrainian political party to Manafort, precipitating his departure from the campaign. In August 2016, the New York Times published a report that a secret ledger had been unearthed in Ukraine showing $12.7 million in payments designated from Viktor Yanukovych’s pro-Russian political party to Manafort between 2007 and 2012. When the story was published, anti-corruption officials in Ukraine told the paper that they had not yet determined whether Manafort had actually received the money. The Occupy Democrats story was based on a later 1 November 2016 NBC report : The FBI has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort's foreign business connections, law enforcement and intelligence sources told NBC News. Word of the inquiry, which has not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation, comes just days after FBI Director James Comey's disclosure that his agency is examining a new batch of emails connected to an aide to Hillary Clinton. While an unnamed source apparently spoke to NBC, the FBI at that time had not not announced an inquiry into Manafort's activities — the Bureau, generally, does not officially confirm whether or not they are investigating a matter, and they responded to our inquiry by saying just that. Similarly, they gave no formal statement to NBC. But on 20 March 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey broke from that practice to announce the FBI was in fact investigating allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. During a public hearing of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey said : The FBI, as part of our counterintelligence effort, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 president election. Less than two months later, President Trump fired Comey, prompting Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein, who had been given oversight of the Russia investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself amid questions about his own communications with Russians, hired Special Counsel Robert Mueller. On 26 July 2017, FBI agents conducted an early-morning raid on the home of then-candidate Trump's former campaign chair Paul Manafort. On 27 October 2017, CNN reported that Mueller had filed the first charges in the investigation and at least one person was expected to be in custody within days.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,571
36aca148-0d34-4983-a57b-6f1dbcc930d2,"On 27 June 2017, the Washington Post published an article about decor at four of President Donald Trump's golf resorts. It revealed that the resorts contained bogus magazine covers made up to look like issues of Time , featuring Trump on the cover and promoting his reality television show ""The Apprentice"": It is not clear who created this fake Time cover — or why. Its date might be a clue: March 1, 2009, was the season debut of Trump’s show “The Celebrity Apprentice.” But a transcript of that show offers no answers. In that episode, various B-list celebrities competed to sell cupcakes, and Trump fired comedian Andrew Dice Clay for poor performance. Nobody mentioned Time magazine. While it’s not difficult to mock up a fake cover using graphic-design software, whoever made this one sought out real Time headlines, to add to the fake. The faux covers were dated 1 March 2009 (the same day ""The Apprentice"" premiered), but as the Washington Post article noted, the magazine did not publish an issue on that date. However, it did publish an issue a day later with actress Kate Winslet on the cover which did not mention Trump at all. Two of the headlines used in the actual 2 March 2009 issue of Time (""How Stressed Is Your Bank? A Checkup"" and ""Obama's Next Move: Can He Curb Health Care Costs?"") appeared on the mocked-up cover, which was spotted on display in Trump resorts in Colorado, New York, New Jersey, Virginia and his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida among others. Employees at the Turnberry resort in Scotland also reported that the cover had been displayed there until they took it down because of ""grumbling about all the stuff like that up on the walls"" by American tourists. The Washington Post, which published the story, later reported that it was also taken down from Trump's golf course in Ireland. The fake magazine cover included a fake bar code which was used in a graphic design tutorial posted by graphic designer Leonardo Amoretti on his blog in 2010, which also displayed a mockup of a ""Time"" cover: Amoretti noted in his post that ""The use of TIME magazine logo on this tutorial is just for instructional purposes and not intended to violate the magazine copyrights."" A spokesperson for the magazine said that it had requested the removal of the faux Time covers from display at Trump resorts.

a7c03b14-8a97-4086-b39d-a24df998b41b,"King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Sau of Saudi Arabia reportedly issued an order in April 2017 that would allow greater freedom for women in his country, while retaining codified examples of its ""guardianship"" policies. According to local media , Saudi women would be allowed to access education and healthcare services from government agencies without needing permission from, or accompaniment by, a male guardian. However, the decree will not apply to areas where ""there is a regulatory obligation for this request,"" meaning companies or services that already have regulations mandating the approval of a male relative are not affected. The country's ""guardianship"" system mandates that a woman's husband, father, brother, or son grant permission to her if she wishes to study internationally, rent an apartment, apply for a passport, or marry, among other actions. Women were also subject to an informal ban on driving, in that it is heavily discouraged by traditional mores. In November 2016 the Shura Council, which advises the king but has no legislative power, refused to consider a petition calling for a study of the issue that reportedly would have included the question, ""What is required to allow them to drive?"" However, the country's foreign ministry announced on 26 September 2017 that by royal decree, Saudi women would be allowed to take driving lessons without a man's permission and be allowed to drive. The civil rights advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in an online post that they had ""reviewed"" the two-page order, which provides government agencies a three-month period during which they must compile a list of services requiring male approval. However, the group said they could not provide us with a version of the order translated into English. Sarah Leah Whitson, Human Rights Watch's Middle East director, said: Saudi Arabia has a tremendous opportunity to root out all vestiges of the guardianship system, and should use the three-month review period King Salman ordered to immediately declare all guardian consent requirements null and void. The king should also require state agencies to actively prevent discrimination by private individuals and businesses. Maha Akeel, a spokesperson for the Saudi Arabia-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation, noted that the easing of guardianship rules could allow women more chances to pursue employment or represent themselves in court, saying: ""Male guardianship is un-Islamic and humiliating for women. Some [men] take advantage of this male guardianship for their own benefit and abuse it. The World Economic Forum ranked Saudi Arabia 141st out of 144 countries in their October 2016 ""Global Gap report ,"" which measures discrepancies between men and women ""across four key areas: health, education, economy and politics.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,503
1d01aa69-1f03-46db-8dc6-cfc0b608cc40,"In late August 2021, readers asked us about reports that a portion of the southern border wall built during the Trump administration was damaged by seasonal rains in Arizona. During his presidential campaign, former U.S. President Donald Trump had stated he would build a wall covering the roughly 2,000-mile U.S. border with Mexico, and that ""Mexico"" would pay for the project. Aside from the fact that parts of the border already had walls, experts had stated that in some places where it didn't, such a project would not be possible. The Mexican government unsurprisingly refused to pay for another country's construction project. The Trump administration pushed forward with construction, ignoring in some regions environmental regulations. Some saw the damage to the wall in Arizona in August 2021, therefore, as the expected fate of a boondoggle. Border Report, a news agency that focuses on the U.S.-Mexico border, reported on Aug. 17, 2021, that 2.15 inches of rain fell in Cochise County, Arizona. Those rains, though not out of character for the region, damaged a ""controversial special movable border wall gates that were built in river beds during the Trump administration."" We reached out to the U.S. Department of Home Security, which oversees border security, asking whether the damaged portion of the wall would be rebuilt and how much it would cost. We also asked that if the wall would be repaired and what would be done to prevent this damage from being a regular occurrence. In response, we received only the following emailed statement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is conducting safety work to secure the project sites and will remove monsoon-related debris that impedes this work. Once these projects are turned over, CBP will assess any remaining make-safe/incomplete items and address them in accordance with the Department of Homeland Security's border wall plan The portion of the wall that was damaged consisted of movable gates placed in a riverbed that ""did not hold up to several feet of rising water that coursed through the desert borderlands region,"" per Border Report. According to the technology news site Gizmodo , the failure of that portion of the wall was predictable, reporting: It turns out ignoring bedrock environmental laws may not have been the best choice for a multibillion-dollar construction project. Photos show former President Donald Trump’s border wall in deep disrepair after summer monsoon rains literally blew floodgates off their hinges. Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity, told Border Report: For years, we have been warning and predicting that exactly this would happen and while this was a significant rainfall, it wasn’t atypical. We always have heavy rains in the monsoon season. This was a highly predictable occurrence. The construction of this wall was so ill-advised and ill-conceived and rushed and inflicted a huge amount of damage for a wall that washed away in its first summer.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,546
97b3735a-448f-495b-a063-013af580422a,"U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation on Aug. 25, 2021, that allows veterans to train and then adopt service dogs trained to help veterans living with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. The new law, Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers, or PAWS Act, was passed with bipartisan support in Congress. According to the law's text , placing a service dog with a veteran costs approximately $25,000. But research indicates these dogs can literally save lives by ameliorating the symptoms of PTSD and thus preventing veteran suicides. Under the law, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will partner with nonprofit organizations like K9s for Warriors, which provides service dogs to disabled veterans. It will give the veterans dogs to train that they will then have the opportunity to adopt. Service dogs help people with various disabilities navigate life. In the case of PTSD, the service dogs -- which can be any breed and, in the case of K9s for Warriors, are often shelter rescues -- are trained to do specific tasks that alleviate depression and anxiety. Tasks include interrupting panic attacks and provide assurance by providing physical cover to a veteran in the types of situations that trigger their PTSD. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health, suicide or substance use crisis or emotional distress, reach out 24/7 to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) by dialing or texting 988 or using chat services at suicidepreventionlifeline.org to connect to a trained crisis counselor.

a00f9bc8-b0a3-43dc-b2c4-889eb3b0389c,"As the Taliban took over major cities across Afghanistan, including Kabul, in August 2021, the U.S. government began efforts to repatriate its many citizens who were working and residing in the country. Desperate scenes of Afghans trying to board flights at Kabul airport went viral, along with reports of gunfire, and large crushing crowds resulting in many deaths . Amid this chaos, one State Department mandate came under scrutiny : Americans trying to catch one of the government chartered flights out of the country were to be charged $2,000 or more for the ticket. This rule was brought to the forefront by Politico , and caused outrage among U.S. politicians such as Ted Cruz, and many on social media. The Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC), a State Department division that provides security cooperation between the government and American private sector groups around the world, posted a notification on its website on Aug. 14, 2021, titled “Afghanistan, Repatriation Assistance for U.S. Citizens."" The alert said people eligible to board a repatriation flight had to be U.S. citizens, and were required to pay for the flight costs. It stated, “Repatriation flights are not free, and passengers will be required to sign a promissory loan agreement and may not be eligible to renew their U.S. passports until the loan is repaid. The cost may be $2,000USD or more per person.” After outrage spread, Ned Price, State Department spokesperson, told The Hill and Politico that “In these unique circumstances, we have no intention of seeking any reimbursement from those fleeing Afghanistan.” When asked by a Politico reporter if they would stop requiring evacuating citizens to sign a promissory loan agreement, he said, “Yes.” Mere days after the original OSAC security alert, it now carries this amendment to the statement, “OSAC notes that the costs involved in repatriation have changed since the U.S. Embassy in Kabul released this Alert. It remains correct for the date of its release, 8/14/2021, but has been superceded by follow-up alerts from the Embassy.” We should note that normally under federal law , “U.S. citizens must reimburse the State Department for evacuation and repatriation expenses incurred on their behalf.” This time, however, the State Department appears to have made an exception. We thus rate this claim as “True,” with the caveat that evacuees are no longer expected to reimburse the government for repatriation fees.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,451
b5278e69-cfd5-4795-910b-18839c2c3d0b,"On Aug. 22, 2021, as former U.S. President Donald Trump held a rally in Alabama, a photograph started circulating on social media that supposedly showed a list of prohibited items: This is a genuine list of items prohibited from Trump rallies. The majority of the items come from a list of prohibited objects maintained by the U.S. Secret Service . While the majority of the items listed above were culled from that Secret Service list, the above-displayed list also prohibits several additional items, such as alcohol, tripods, and appliances or toasters. The above-displayed list appears to be relatively standard for Trump rallies. We found guidelines for several of Trump's previous rallies that also prohibited these items. Before a rally at Eerie National Airport in October 2020, for example, the local news outlet YourErie.com reported that the following items were prohibited at the event: Prohibited Items List • Aerosols • Alcoholic beverages • Backpacks, bags, roller bags, suitcases bags exceeding size restrictions (12”x14”x5”) • Balloons • Balls • Banners, signs, placards • Chairs • Coolers • Drones and other unmanned aircraft systems • Explosives of any kind (including fireworks) • Glass, thermal and metal containers • Laser lights and laser pointers • E-Cigarrettes and Vaping Devices • Mace and/or pepper spray • Noisemakers, such as air horns, whistles, drums, bullhorns, etc. • Packages • Poles, sticks and selfie sticks • Spray containers • Structures • Supports for signs/placards • Tripods • Umbrellas • Appliances (i.e. Toasters) • And any other items that may pose a threat to the security of the event as determined by and at the discretion of the security screeners. The Sheriff's Department in Cullman County, where the August 2021 Trump rally was held, told us that the prohibited items list was put together by the Secret Service and the event organizers. As the Secret Service's list of prohibited items does not include appliances, it seems reasonable that this item was added by the Trump team. It should be noted, however, that while the idea that ""Trump bans toasters"" may sound funny, there could be a good reason for prohibiting appliances. One possible reason is that some appliances, such as pressure cookers , have been used to make homemade bombs. We reached out to the Secret Service, Trump's Save America Pac, and rally host York Family Farms for more information, and we will update this article accordingly if we hear back. While there may be a good reason to prohibit appliances, we viewed the prohibited items list for a few large events held for Trump's predecessor, former President Barack Obama, and found no mention of toasters.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,505
4785e8be-b9f2-46b5-8c92-85acf4815885,"As the Taliban took over Afghanistan in mid-August 2021, and foreign powers departed from the region, many analyzed the role of successive U.S. governments in creating and exacerbating the problem. One meme in particular targeted the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump for its part in releasing a major Taliban figure, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. The meme claims that, “In 2018 Trump helped Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar get released from prison. In 2020, Trump’s Secretary of State met with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. In 2021, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar appears set to become the new president of Afghanistan under Taliban rule.” Baradar was captured by American and Pakistani agents in 2010, and was held by Pakistan for most of the decade. Then-President Hamid Karzai had been trying to get the Pakistani government to release him for years, hoping that it would jumpstart peace talks. As the U.S. began the process of peace talks with the Taliban, the U.S. also worked on pressuring the Pakistani government to release him. Then finally in 2018 , the Pakistani government succumbed to U.S. pressure and released Baradar. Trump selected special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to facilitate the peace process. Khalilzad admitted in a 2019 talk at the U.S. Institute for Peace that he had requested the release of Baradar. He argued that Baradar had a reputation of being more “pro-peace.” He made the comments around 39 minutes into the video below: In September 2020, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a photograph of himself meeting with Baradar, to mark the beginning of peace negotiations between the U.S. and the Taliban. This is the same photograph that was used in the above meme. Baradar met Pompeo twice in 2020, and even spoke to Trump on the phone, according to The Economist . Negotiators described Baradar as quiet and difficult to read, but also as someone who was always able to facilitate a breakthrough. Others complained that he controlled communication very tightly, not allowing much room for dialogue in other meetings. Right before the Taliban took over Kabul, Baradar was its public face, assuring American diplomats that they could evacuate before they arrived. He is widely considered to be one of the main, publicly known leaders among the Taliban since the collapse of the Afghan government, making statements that have been spread on social media. He has also been a central figure in the movement from its earliest days under Mullah Omar, acting as a military commander during the Taliban takeover in 1994, according to The Wall Street Journal. Despite Baradar currently being a central figure in the Taliban, it is not yet known how it will form a government, nor has it made any announcement of who would be a possible “president” or similar figure. Many online outlets are predicting that he could be the possible leader of Afghanistan under the Taliban.

08a3eebb-0134-4d31-957a-0e5563225e0e,"In the first half of 2021, more of Florida’s manatees have died than in any other year in state history records, according to new estimates published by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. At least 841 manatees died in Florida waters between Jan. 1 and July 2, 2021, breaking a previous record of 830 manatee deaths in 2013 following a red tide outbreak. (By comparison, the five-year average has been 352 deaths per year.) Wildlife officials blame the mass mortality event on a large die-off of seagrass, manatees’ primary food source, along a large mangrove wetland area known as Indian River Lagoon. ""Unprecedented manatee mortality due to starvation was documented on the Atlantic coast this past winter and spring,"" wrote the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI). ""Most deaths occurred during the colder months when manatees migrated to and through the Indian River Lagoon, where the majority of seagrass has died off."" Known colloquially as “sea cows,” Florida’s West Indian manatees head to the warmer waters of the Indian River Lagoon to forage. These large grazers can consume up to 9% of their body weight in a day in seagrass and other species of submerged aquatic plants, but for unknown reasons, this vital food source is declining rapidly. “The long-term health effects of prolonged starvation in manatees that survived the Atlantic event to this point are not yet known,” wrote the FWC in its report. “FWC remains committed to monitor and investigate manatee health, respond to manatees in need of rescue, and implement science-based conservation measures that protect manatees and their habitat.” It comes after wildlife officials declared an Unusual Mortality Event (UME) in March, which prompts a federal government collaboration between state and local entities to immediately investigate the cause of deaths, as was first reported by southeastern Florida’s digital newspaper TC Palm. And while a preliminary report indicated that a reduction in the seagrass was primarily responsible for the die-off, the FWC has not yet determined what is causing the seagrass die-off. As temperatures warmed up in the later months of the year, manatees on the Atlantic coast dispersed to other habitats for foraging, lessening the number that died from starvation. In June, boat strikes once again became the leading cause of death: as of this writing, a total of 63 manatees had been killed by boats.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,450

92e3243d-83db-4753-8b94-87fbcb2b6ffc,"In July 2021, Snopes readers contacted us to determine the legitimacy of reports claiming an Utah group representing Black Lives Matter described the American flag as a ""symbol of hatred,"" and called those who fly it racists, on the Fourth of July. The underlying claim was true, though some context is necessary to make sense of the group's role within the national Black Lives Matter movement — a decentralized effort to call attention to police brutality's disproportionate impact on Black Americans. Firstly, below is a transcribed version of an authentic July 4 post by a Facebook group titled ""Black Lives Matter Utah Chapter,"" which we also included as the feature image for this report. When we Black Americans see this flag we know the person flying it is not safe to be around. When we see this flag we know the person flying it is a racist. When we see this flag we know that the person flying it lives in a different America than we do. When we see this flag, we question your intelligence. We know to avoid you. It is a symbol of hatred. As the post spread rapidly online, Lex Scott , founder of Black Lives Matter Utah, told The Salt Lake Tribune the post was authored after she saw photos of a white nationalist hate group, Patriot Front, marching through Philadelphia carrying the American flag. “We are seeing that symbol used in every racist hate group’s messaging across this nation,"" Scott told the local newspaper. ""I am telling you when I see an American flag, I begin to feel fear for the simple fact that every time I am faced with hatred, it is at the hands of someone carrying an American flag.” In a statement on the group's website , Scott said again she stood by the sentiment, and shared dozens of voicemails and messages filled with racial slurs and threats from people condemning the post. ""They are proving our point,"" the message read. However, let us note here: The Facebook post went viral, in part, due to social media posts (like the one displayed below) that erroneously claimed all supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement believed in the Utah group's statement about the American flag. In reality, that was not the case. While it was true the Utah chapter called the flag a ""symbol of hatred"" and those who fly it racists, there was no widely-available evidence of other Black Lives Matter groups or like-minded activists making similar proclamations on the Fourth of July. In fact, Jeanetta Williams, president of the NAACP Utah State Conference, condemned the above-transcribed post, writing in a statement to local media outlets : ""The NAACP ... rejects the idea that flying the American flag is a racist message,"" the statement read, according to The Salt Lake Tribune . ""The flag stands for all the people who have lived and served to bring about the best of the American experience, that all people are created equal."" Furthermore, the Utah group was not formally part of the Black Lives Matter Global Network — the civil rights movement's parent organization that connects local chapters across the world with a political action committee and partnerships with corporations and politicians. The Utah group's website included following disclaimer: ""We are an independent chapter,"" the website stated. ""Each chapter of black lives matter has different objectives."" To conclude our analysis, we reached out to the Black Lives Matter Utah Chapter with a series of questions including whether it was aware of any other BLM groups or activists expressing similar statements and why it was not part of the broader network. We have not received a response, but we will update this report when, or if, that changes. In sum, we rate this claim ""True"" with the important caveat that Snopes found no evidence of other groups affiliated with, or representing, the Black Lives Matter movement taking a similar stance on the American flag.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,753

The Four Seasons confusion began in November 2020, when then-U.S. President Donald Trump was engaged in an aggressive disinformation campaign aimed at undermining the results of the presidential election, which he lost to current President Joe Biden. Trump took to his now- permanently suspended Twitter account to announce there would be a ""Lawyers Press Conference at Four Seasons, Philadelphia.""

7e0925f6-d0b1-4a37-a1d6-959bc49e83f7,"In summer 2021, reports surfaced claiming Caitlyn Jenner , a former Olympic champion and TV personality who months earlier launched a campaign for California governor, laid out her solution to Los Angeles County's homelessness problem. According to the reports, the Republican candidate suggested moving chronically-homeless people — particularly those living on the Venice Beach boardwalk — to ""big open fields."" The underlying claim was true, though absent of some context, which we explain below. Firstly, Los Angeles County's homeless population is estimated at more than 60,000, according to The Associated Press . Among them were dozens of people living in makeshift shelters and tents along Venice Beach's famous boardwalk at the time of Jenner's comments on June 29. (Note: On July 8, The Los Angeles Times reported city crews were clearing those homeless camps.) In the interview with KTLA 5, a local TV news station for the Los Angeles area, Jenner indeed said the following: Jenner: Just the other day I went to Venice Beach, just to kind of see, got my bike. [...] Rode my bike down there. We have to clean those places up. We have to provide some place for those people to go, whether it's an open field out someplace. Or, if you've noticed, at the veteran's facility, there's these big open fields and a lot of places there. We have to be able to get them out there. It's just not fair. Venice Beach is destroyed. KTLA anchor Frank Buckley: So are you suggesting that those people would camp in some of these open fields? Jenner: We're going to find some place, if they are going to be camping [...]. They're destroying Venice Beach; they're destroying all the businesses down there; they don't need to be there. The crime rate is going up. [...] It's mostly homeless-on-homeless murders. We have to, we can't have that in our streets. We have to clean that up. But then also we have to provide, 'Here's a place where you can go — wherever it may be, we can find some open land — this is where you can pitch your tent.' Not right down there in the center. So, the businesses, you know, can open up. People can go enjoy our wonderful Southern California. In other words, Jenner suggested that government officials should do a better job cleaning up the popular boardwalk, and said that that effort should include kicking out the homeless people living there and providing them new places to sleep. Among her suggested locations for moving those people were unspecified ""big open fields,"" without elaborating further. However, she did not affirm the journalist's follow-up question about whether she indeed believed homeless people should camp in big open fields. Rather, Jenner stressed ""we can't have [homeless people living] in our streets"" and that officials need to provide a new place for them to go ""wherever it may be."" With that said, Jenner indeed floated the idea of moving people living on city streets to ""big open fields,"" though she also appeared open to other types of locations for setting up new homeless encampments. The gubernatorial candidate roughly 31-minute interview with Buckley was video recorded (watch the segment in which Jenner made the above-transcribed statements here ), as well as recirculated by other news outlets. She discussed not only homelessness on Venice Beach but her ideas on immigration , among other social issues.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,675

Hobby Lobby was selling all kinds of crafts that customers used to celebrate Christmas, yet David Green was struck by the lack of any testimony in newspapers regarding the meaning of the holiday. David Green responded to that commission in 1996 by creating a simple newspaper ad that began: As you celebrate this Christmas season in the warmth of family and home, may you be drawn to the Savior; He who left the beauty of Heaven on our behalf and became like us, that we might become like Him. If you know Jesus as your Savior, then this season already has a special meaning.

a0039519-addd-4409-a637-f2bef817ff5a,"In June 2021, as U.S. athletes competed in trials for the July Olympic Games in Tokyo, women's hammer thrower Gwen Berry prompted an outraged response from some quarters for her actions during a medal ceremony at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon. On June 29, CBS News reported: Hammer thrower and activist Gwen Berry has received fierce backlash after she appeared to turn her back to the American flag as the national anthem was being played at the U.S. Olympic Trials over the weekend. Berry, who famously protested during the anthem in the 2019 Pan American Games , caught attention for turning her body toward the stands and away from the flag as ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" was playing at the trials in Eugene, Oregon on Saturday. Toward the end of the song, she put a black T-shirt with the words ""Activist Athlete"" on her head. Her competitors DeAnna Price, who won first place, and Brooke Andersen, second place winner, put their hands over their hearts and faced the flag. Following her protest of the anthem, she drew ire from some conservative voices. Texas congressman Dan Crenshaw said Monday that Berry should be removed from the team . While sharing an article of the incident, Senator Ted Cruz tweeted , ""Why does the Left hate America?"" Former Republican presidential candidate and ex-Wisconsin governor Scott Walker also blasted Berry on Twitter. Similar reports were published by CNN and The Athletic . Those articles accurately described Berry's actions, and as such we are issuing a rating of ""True."" Berry, from St. Louis, Missouri , finished third in the women's hammer throw, thus earning a place on the American team for a second successive Olympic Games. The medal ceremony does not appear to have been televised, and we were not able find video footage of it. However, several photographs of the ceremony, including the one below, clearly show Berry turning away as the first- and second-placed competitors, DeAnna Price and Brooke Andersen, placed their hands on their hearts while the national anthem was played. (Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images) At one point during the anthem, Berry draped over her head a t-shirt bearing the slogan "" Activist athlete ."" Susan Hazzard, a spokesperson for USA Track and Field, told The Associated Press the national anthem was played at around the same time during every day of the trials, 5:20 p.m., and that this happened to coincide with the women's hammer throw medal ceremony on June 26. According to the AP, the anthem was played slightly later on that date, at 5:25 p.m. Berry has claimed it was delayed as a ""set up"" targeting her specifically. Hazzard insisted: ""We didn’t wait until the athletes were on the podium for the hammer throw awards."" Speaking to The Washington Post , Berry confirmed that she turned away during the playing of the anthem as a form of protest against racial injustice and police brutality: I think sports is a distraction. Sports is entertainment. But my purpose and my voice and mission is bigger than the sport. So me being able to represent my communities and my people and those who have died at the hands of police brutality, those who have died to this systemic racism, I feel like that’s the important part. That’s why I’m going. And that’s why I was here today.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,641
91a61f7d-72b3-46f4-9b74-4509a5235876,"In late June 2021, numerous reports circulated claiming a statue of George Floyd in New York City was vandalized and spray-painted with a white nationalist slogan less than a week after the monument was installed to commemorate Juneteenth. The claim was true. First, the 6-foot statue to memorialize the 46-year-old Black man who was killed by Minneapolis police in 2020 was unveiled on June 19 — the anniversary of one of the final acts of emancipation of slaves in the U.S. Then, on the morning of June 24, the wooden monument was found covered in black spray paint, including an inscription in white spray paint reading, ""PATRIOTFRONT.US,"" according to visual evidence from the scene on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn and the New York City's police department (NYPD) . The ""PATRIOTFRONT.US"" label represents a group of white nationalists that was founded in 2017 by Thomas Rousseau , the same person who led a Neo-Nazi group called Vanguard America , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors far-right extremism. SPLC describes Patriot Front as ""an image-obsessed organization that rehabilitated the explicitly fascist agenda of Vanguard America with garish patriotism."" Lindsay Eshelman, who helped produce the statue, told ABC reporters the vandalism was devastating. ""Someone in the name of hate, came through the night and defaced it. [...] They snuck in,"" Eshelman said. ""They seem to be incredibly focused on patriotism. But, in my eyes, this was not 'patriotism', this was terrorism."" The NYPD was investigating the incident as a hate crime, which means detectives believed the suspects were motivated by racism, or other prejudice, to deface the monument. Law enforcement officials told The New York Times that, at least twice, people with ties to the group have allegedly unveiled large banners bearing its slogans and other information across major avenues in New York City. CBS New York reported NYPD considered Patriot Front to be an organized extremist group. As of this writing, authorities had not made any arrests, and it was unknown who exactly committed the crime. NYPD had released photos from surveillance video supposedly showing four male suspects — one of whom Al Jazeera reported was holding a spray can — in the area just hours before the property destruction was discovered. In the tweet displayed below, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was indeed a far-right extremist group that vandalized the statue, and that NYPD's investigation to find the individuals would lead to criminal charges. Gov. Andrew Cuomo commented on the incident, too, posting the below-displayed statement in which he said he directed state authorities who investigate hate crimes to assist NYPD in making arrests. ""To the group of neo-Nazis who did this, I want to be absolutely clear: get the hell out of our state,"" the governor tweeted. Around the same time, Chris Carnabuci, the artist who created the sculpture, told The New York Times that crews were working to remove the paint and fix any other damage to the statue, which is to remain in Brooklyn for several weeks before a planned move to Union Square in Manhattan. “I’m saddened by it,” he told the newspaper, referring to the vandalism. ""I''m not completely shocked."" Meanwhile, officials in Newark, New Jersey, were also searching for an individual or group that defaced a recently installed, 700-pound bronze statue of Floyd at City Hall, according to news reports . Here's how the monument looked before the vandalism: The statue's graffiti featured the web address of the same white supremacist group, reading: ""LIFE...LIBERTY VICTORY PATRIOTFRONT.US,"" according to ABC7 New York . ""The defacing of the statue of George Floyd has been a trend around the country,"" Mayor Ras Baraka told reporters . ""This horrible act is the very reason that this statue needs to remain and be upheld. As this is not just about George Floyd, it's a deliberate effort to push back against and ultimately dismantle systems of hatred, racism, and white supremacy."" News of the vandalism on the East Coast spread about a day before the former police officer who was convicted of murdering Floyd, Derek Chauvin , was scheduled to be sentenced in Minneapolis. He faced decades in prison, with several legal experts predicting a sentence of 20 to 25 years, The Associated Press reported.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,828

2e306832-4e65-4b1c-a159-5102554da362,"In June 2021, a filibuster by Senate Republicans held up the ""For the People Act,"" a sweeping piece of legislation designed to introduce federal reforms of elections in the United States, including expanding voter registration and early voting provisions, increasing public funding for campaigns, and making Election Day a federal holiday. A set of compromise measures put forward by moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia could provide a path forward for the reforms, but for now, their progress has been stalled. On June 22, Mother Jones highlighted what it characterized as a glaring democratic deficit in the vote to halt the For the People Act, writing that: The 50 Democratic senators who support the For the People Act (or least Sen. Joe Manchin’s compromise proposal keeping some key elements of the bill while excluding others) represent 43 million more Americans than the 50 Republican senators who oppose it, according to data compiled by Alex Tausanovitch of the Center for American Progress. Yet because of the 60-vote requirement to pass most legislation, 41 Republican senators representing just 21 percent of the country can block the bill from moving forward, even though it’s supported by 68 percent of the public, according to recent polling. The composition of the U.S. Senate — two members from each state, regardless of each state's population — has always disproportionately favored states with smaller populations. This is not by accident, but rather is a feature of the way the United States' bicameral national legislature is constructed, with House districts based on population size, and the Senate designed, in principle, to counter-balance that influence by giving smaller states outsized power. Nonetheless, the figure calculated by Alex Tausanovitch from the Center for American Progress, and presented by Ari Berman for Mother Jones — that the 50 Republicans opposed to the For the People Act represented 43 million fewer people than the 50 Democrats who supported it — was remarkable and, as it turns out, accurate. The Democratic-majority House passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act, in March 2021. Its companion bill in the Senate, S. 2093, was introduced on June 16. On June 22, senators debated a motion to proceed , followed by a motion of cloture on that motion to proceed. A motion of cloture is a proposal, signed by at least 16 senators, to end the current debate on a particular motion, and advance the underlying legislation, with the ultimate aim of holding a full vote on the bill. In order to progress the For the People Act, Democrats in the Senate needed a three-fifths majority on the cloture motion on June 22. However, the vote ended 50-50 , along strict party lines, thus effectively bringing the bill's progress to a halt. All 48 Democratic senators voted for the motion, along with independents Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who both caucus with the Democrats. All 50 Republican senators voted against the motion, and therefore against the advancement of the underlying legislation. Using the most accurate and recent data available — the resident population for all 50 states, taken from the Census Bureau's "" 2020 Census Apportionment Results "" — we calculated the total population represented by each senator. A quick housekeeping note: In reality, each individual senator represents a whole state, but because, in some states, the two senators voted differently, we interpreted each individual senator as effectively representing half the state's population, for the purposes of these calculations. A detailed breakdown can be found here . In summary, though, the 50 senators — Democrats and independents — who voted for the motion, effectively represent close to 187 million people. By contrast, the 50 Republican senators who voted against it effectively represent 144 million people. That's a difference of slightly more than 43 million people, exactly as Tausanovitch and Berman stated.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,728
f80726d2-5e22-44bb-8b8e-364bd82461c4,"In June 2021, Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib came out as gay , making history as the first openly gay active NFL player. Given the high-profile nature of his announcement, it was perhaps unsurprising that the episode quickly turned political, with claims that Nassib is registered to vote as a Republican. On June 22, for example, right-wing activist Brigitte Gabriel tweeted : ""FUN FACT: The first openly gay active NFL player, Carl Nassib, is a registered Republican voter."" Some left-leaning and LGBTQ observers expressed disappointment at such claims , and others posted what appeared to be screenshots of voter registration details relating to Nassib. In general, readers should be wary of claims about a specific individual's party affiliation and voter registration, which often crop up in the aftermath of arrests, scandals and other controversies. Links and screenshots purporting to contain such details often come from unofficial and unreliable sources. It should also be noted that Nassib's personal political beliefs and party affiliation are of no inherent interest to the writers and editors at Snopes, and that this fact check is simply in response to widespread and substantive factual claims about a public figure currently in the news. In any event, Snopes has checked official, reliable voter registration data from Nevada and Florida, and can confirm that Nassib is indeed registered to vote as a Republican, and has been in at least two states, since May 2019 at the latest. We are therefore issuing a rating of ""True."" Nassib joined the Raiders in March 2020, and lives in Las Vegas. On June 23, Snopes downloaded voter rolls from the 16th state assembly district, from the official website of Clark County, Nevada. That database contains an entry for Carl Paul Nassib, born in 1993, with an address in Las Vegas, and shows that he is an active voter who registered as a Republican on Nov. 3, 2020 — the date of the most recent general election. In the screenshot below, we have redacted certain columns which, although public record, contained personal details including Nassib's home address: Before joining the Raiders, Nassib played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and lived in Hillsborough County, Florida. We checked registration information on the official website of the Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections, and found that Nassib registered as a Republican there on May 15, 2019. We have redacted Nassib's voter registration number, as well as his residential and permanent addresses, from the screenshot below: Before joining the Buccaneers, Nassib played for the Cleveland Browns. Information found on the official website of the Medina County Board of Elections showed that he voted there in the 2016 general election, on Nov. 8, but did not indicate his party affiliation at that time, if any. As we have shown, Nassib has been registered as a Republican in two different states — Florida and Nevada — since May 2019 at the latest, and he was registered as a Republican for the most recent general election, in November 2020. The claim that Nassib is registered to vote, as a Republican, is therefore undoubtedly accurate, as of June 2021.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,592

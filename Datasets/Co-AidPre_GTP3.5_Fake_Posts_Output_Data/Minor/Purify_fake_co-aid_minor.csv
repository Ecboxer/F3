Local Restaurant Shuts Down After Employee Caught Selling Fake Vaccine Cards

In a shocking turn of events, a popular restaurant in town has been forced to shut down after one of its employees was caught selling fake COVID-19 vaccine cards. The employee, who had been showing symptoms of the virus, continued to work and even interacted closely with patrons while carrying the infection.

Authorities are urging anyone who recently dined at the restaurant to get tested immediately and to follow CDC guidelines for dealing with potential exposure to COVID-19. The restaurant's management is facing severe backlash for not enforcing proper safety measures and allowing such reckless behavior to take place.

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of staying vigilant during these times and following guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus.

Prince Harry: ‘There Is Much More We Can Do’ To Promote Mental Health Awareness  Speaking at a panel event entitled “Encouraging Happy Young Minds” in Leeds, the prince suggested that young people need to take a moment to think things over before moving on. “I read recently that young people check their phones at least 150 times a day,” he said. “I’m sure we could all be more effective and efficient if we took a moment to process our thoughts rather than rush to the next one.”  Prince Harry, along with Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, have spearheaded new mental health campaign, Head Together, which has initiated important conversation around the country.  “I cannot tell you how pleased William, Catherine and I are that the dial seems to have shifted and that there is now a greater understanding, compassion and kindness for anyone who opens up about their struggles.  “But let’s not kid ourselves that the job is done – there is much more that we can do at every level to make conversations about mental health as commonplace as those about physical health.”  Mental health awareness is a subject close to his heart.

The album is due Feb. 2 — two days before his halftime performance on the Super Bowl on Feb. 4.  “This album is really inspired by my son, my wife, my family, but more so than any album I’ve ever written, where I’m from — it’s personal,” he says in the video, which is filled with shots of Timberlake in outdoors settings. In other shots he is seen working with Pharrell Williams, who says “It feels so earthy, it’s just where you are in your life right now,” before adding emphatically, “That is a smash,” presumably about a song. Snippets of two or three new songs play in the background during the video.  While the wintery scenes contrast with Timberlake’s upbringing in Memphis, Tennessee, he has been saying for some months that the album, on which he also worked with longtime collaborators Max Martin and Shellback (with whom he collaborated on his last single, the hit “Can’t Stop the Feeling” from the movie “Trolls”) and Timbaland, reflected his roots, calling it “Southern American music.”  Timberlake’s halftime performance during the Super Bowl is set for Sunday, Feb. 4 at Minneapolis’ U.S. Bank Stadium.

According to The United States District Court for the Central District of California documents filed Monday — and obtained by The Blast — “Pursuant to Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and by leave of court endorsed hereon, the United States Attorney for the Central District of California hereby moves to dismiss the above-referenced case as to defendant Mark Wayne Salling, without prejudice.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Salling was found hanging from a tree in the area of the Los Angeles River in Sunland, California, according to Los Angeles Coroner Assistant Chief Ed Winter, and was pronounced dead at 9 a.m. on Jan. 30 at age 35.  According to Winter, his cause of death was asphyxia by hanging and has been ruled a suicide.  The late actor’s attorney, Michael Proctor, confirmed his death to PEOPLE and said in a statement, “Mark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgment. He is survived by his mother and father, and his brother. The Salling family appreciates the support they have been receiving and asks for their privacy to be respected.”  WATCH: Mark Salling’s Mom ‘Had a Hard Time Grasping’ His Child Porn Scandal: The ‘Family Is Devastated’  His death came just a month before he was to be sentenced to prison for possession of child pornography.  He was arrested in December 2015 after LAPD’s Internet Crimes Against Children unit obtained a search warrant for his home in Sunland, California. Federal investigators say they found more than 25,000 images and 600 videos depicting child pornography on computers and thumb drives that belonged to Salling. The content depicted children as young as 3 years old being abused, according to court documents.  Salling pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor in October. After striking a plea deal in December, he was due to be sentenced in March and expected to serve four to seven years in prison.  “Mark is focused on accepting responsibility and attempting to atone for his conduct,” Proctor said in a statement at the time.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,431

Gregg DeGuire/WireImage/Getty Images  On Saturday night, a deputy responded to a domestic violence complaint in Chesapeake, West Virginia, authorities said. Dorsey claimed to the responding deputy that Rivera struck him in the head and face. He had minor injuries consistent with his claims, and further showed authorities a video taken during the alleged incident.  “While we will not release details of the incident beyond what is in the criminal complaint (charging document), we will say the two were arguing over their child,” Sgt.

Until they made it.  In a new interview, Kunis opened up about the origins of their romance and revealed why it didn't happen much earlier.  Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher on ""That '70s Show"" in 1998. Alamy Stock  The stars first met on the set of ""That '70s Show,"" when she was just 14 and he was 19, and as fans of the series know, they played each other's love interest for much of the show's 8-season run.  But despite on-screen chemistry and made-for-TV make-out sessions, they were nothing more that platonic pals off screen.  ""Yep, in the show (we kissed), with no feelings whatsoever,"" Kunis explained to comedian Marc Maron for his ""WTF"" podcast. ""It's the weirdest story that nobody believes, but it's the god's honest truth. There was nothing there, and it was like ... whatever.""  And looking back now, at the age of 34, part of her regrets that.  ""We could have spent 20 years together,"" she said of how long they would have been together if they'd made a love connection back then.  But there was never really a chance of that happening — and not just because she was way too young for that when they met.  ""We would have never been together if we didn't both go through what we went through in order to be the people that we were when we reconnected,"" she insisted.  That included long-running relationships with others — in particular, her romance with actor Macaulay Culkin and Kutcher's marriage to Demi Moore — and the life lessons that came with them.  However, even then, neither imagined they would have a future together until they stumbled into one.  ""We were at an awards show, and I was backstage,"" she recalled. ""I was like looking around, and there was like a really beautiful man from the back. I was like, 'What a very nice stature of a gentleman.' I was literally, like, 'Ooh, he's kind of hot.' I was single. And then he turned around, and I was like, 'Oh, my god! It's Kutch!' I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was somebody I'd known forever.""  Soon enough, the duo went from friends to friends-with-benefits.  ""We never dated,"" Kunis continued. ""Let me be clear — Ash and I hooked up. Literally, I did a movie called 'Friends With Benefits,' he did a movie that was very similar, 'No Strings Attached.' We lived our movies out.""  That went on until one of them felt something more than friendship.  ""I walked up to him and I was like, 'You know what? I actually care about you, and I don't wanna mess anything up, so I'm just going to walk away before it becomes too much,'"" she recalled. ""And he was like, 'Got it.'""  Of course, since they're now married and have two kids together, that wasn't quite the end of the story.  ""The next day he showed up to my house, and he was like, 'Move in with me.'""  Her reply was a simple ""OK.""  But it wasn't so simple for someone else when Kunis shared the happy news. During a recent chat on Dax Shepard's ""Armchair Expert"" podcast, she revealed that her mother had a particularly memorable (and hilarious) reaction.  ""We were driving up Laurel Canyon, and I was like, ‘Mom, I have to tell you I’m dating somebody,'"" Kunis said. ""And she was like, ‘Oh, tell me! Who are you dating?’ And I was like, ‘You’ve got to brace yourself for this one. ... I’m dating Ashton Kutcher.’""  To which Kutcher's now-mother-in-law responded, ""'Shut the f--- up!' in Russian.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,837

In California, where Kardashian lives, revenge porn is a criminal offence and it is illegal to intentionally distribute ""the image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person”.  The penalty is up to six months in prison and a $1,000 (£770) fine. A number of legal experts have said Kardashian may have potentially violated the state's revenge porn laws.  Lisa Bloom, the women's rights lawyer who represented Mischa Barton in her recent successful civil suit against an ex to prevent revenge-porn images of her from being released, weighed in on the furore on Twitter, saying: ""Note to Rob Kardashian: revenge porn is a crime. And in my Mischa Barton case judge agreed it's a form of domestic violence. Knock it off"".  In October 2013, the California Governor signed a bill outlawing so-called revenge porn and levying possible prison time for those who post naked photos of their ex-partners. In 2014, the first person was convicted and sentenced to a year in prison for violating the law.  The former couple, who have a daughter called Dream, announced their engagement last April.

Actress Meghan Markle is invited to join boyfriend Prince Harry at Pippa Middleton’s wedding to James Matthews next month, multiple outlets reported this week. However, there’s a caveat.  When Middleton, 33, weds Matthews, 41, at St. Mark’s Church in Berkshire on May 20, Markle will not be present for the actual ceremony. According to People, unwritten protocol calls for only the married and engaged partners of invited guests to physically witness the bride and groom exchange vows. The bride and groom are already expected to have a small wedding, though they’re opening up the after-party to a larger number of guests.  While the Suits actress will not witness the nuptials, Markle has secured a seat at the couple’s reception. According to Us Weekly, the outdoor party will be held at the Middleton family’s Bucklebury estate later that evening, and a luxury tent will be erected on the grounds of the garden.  Markle’s invite to the high-profile nuptials indicates that she and Prince Harry are getting rather serious. According to Us, this isn’t the first wedding the two have attended together. The actress also recently joined Harry in Jamaica for his best friend Tom Inskip’s destination nuptials.  One source tells the magazine that an engagement is expected sometime in 2017. Just this past Easter weekend, Prince Harry joined Markle in Toronto in lieu of formal Easter festivities with Queen Elizabeth II.  While Markle has scored a place card at what’s expected to be the wedding of the year, the Canadian native will miss out on loads of cuteness during the ceremony.

5e1979df-9ef6-409e-a677-35f34e88c1c5,"(If you’re having trouble viewing this video on a mobile device, click here.)  Where’s Kylie? That’s the question Kardashian fans were asking when the reality TV family finally unveiled their annual Christmas card Monday afternoon but a reportedly pregnant Kylie Jenner was noticeably absent.  In fact, fans were fuming on Twitter and elsewhere that they had fallen for what turned out to be a 25-day-long tease to the card’s release.  Each day, starting Dec. 1, Kim Kardashian and other members of the clan released a photo from the family’s Christmas card photo shoot, showing different group shots, including of Kim and Kanye West with their two kids, North and Saint.  Fans had expected that 20-year-old Kylie, reported to be well into her first pregnancy with her rapper boyfriend Travis Scott, would finally display her baby bump on the Dec. 25 card.  Instead, the card showed nearly all the Kardashian-Jenner women and grandchildren, including Kris Jenner and grandmother Mary Jo “M.J.” Houghton. But there was no Kylie Jenner.  Khloe Kardashian was there, though with no baby bump yet visible, possibly because the photo shoot took place sometime in early November, E! News reported. She already had confirmed her pregnancy on Dec. 20 with a baby bump photo posted to her Instagram account.  Khloe’s long-expected public acknowledgement that, yes, she is having a baby with NBA star Tristan Thompson raised fans’ expectations that Kylie would use the family’s annual card to publicly confirm her pregnancy as well.  But when Kylie didn’t, fans seemed ready to declare a national state of emergency or a state of something related to the family.  “Maybe we should call the authorities because @KylieJenner is still missing from the damn Kardashian Christmas card,” one fan tweeted.  “I need to see the BELLY,” wrote another.  “I hate that I am so invested in Kylie Jenner’s alleged pregnancy,” another tweeted.  Others grew more belligerent and hurled expletives:  “Lmaoooooo THEY MIND F—KED US ALL MONTH LONG!!!!” one put it bluntly. “What is this total f—kery they have done to us!!! C’mon @KylieJenner @KimKardashian we wanted Kylie on the damn 25th day!!!”  But the young lip kit mogul wasn’t in total hiding on Christmas Day. She and big brother Rob Kardashian, who also was absent from the family holiday card photos, appeared on Khloe’s Snapchat on Monday. Kylie also shared a photo of herself on the cover of Love magazine, though the photo only showed her face.  Still her absence from the Christmas card itself left fans wondering if she’ll ever confirm her pregnancy or what other occasion she’s holding out for — perhaps for the next season of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”  Here are some more fan reactions:  this would’ve been the perfect marketing ploy. so why didn’t they use it? where is kylie and that bump? pic.twitter.com/E77ur2KJnY — 💿 (@squareups) December 26, 2017  She must be behind that tree — 🌻📷 (@IviweVikki) December 26, 2017",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,604

Larson spoke with Vanity Fair for its May issue about her friendships with the other A-list actresses, revealing that the trio has become each other’s support system through a group text—which also happens to include Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer. (It keeps getting better.)  The actress explained that she began to rely on the women during the grueling and uncomfortable process of promoting her Oscar-winning work in Room . “I felt lonely and bad sometimes. I was embarrassed to keep talking about myself,” she said.  An unexpected but “beautiful” email from Stone and a text from Lawrence, turned into powerful relationships.  “That [group of friends] saved my life,” she said. “I was able to talk with them about everything that was going on in my life, and it was with people who had been through it before and are also hilarious. That support and acceptance was everything. I was home-schooled, so I didn’t have friends that had the same interests as me, and I found it to be absolutely incredible.”  This isn’t the first time Larson has gushed about her celebrity comrades. After the 2017 Academy Awards, Larson posted a picture to Instagram of her embracing a tearful Stone. But the duo’s cute Oscars behavior extends back even farther than this year. Larson revealed to Vanity Fair that last year, when she was nominated, Stone gave her a good luck card alongside a gift: the book I Can Fly .  “It’s those little things,” Larson said of Stone’s gesture.  Larson also opened up about getting to know Lawrence, whom she met through costar Woody Harrelson, who had likewise introduced Stone and Lawrence. Larson explained that she and Lawrence happened to be in Montreal at the same time, and hung out every week.  “We just had a blast together, going to get dinner every Saturday night. It gave us all a chance to connect,” Larson said.  Harrelson also praised the group of actresses, calling them “a very tight-knit group who keep them honest and keep their ego in check.”  And with Larson recently snagging the coveted titular role in Captain Marvel —the first female-led Marvel superhero film—it seems Larson will be needing those friends by her side more than ever. After all, every superhero needs her sidekicks.  Read more about Larson's upcoming films and her friendships on vanityfair.com , and pick up the May issue on newsstands starting May 2.

eb15e63d-b0e1-4256-b118-3caab75499e7,"Oh, hi there, fellow pizza face. This might be the least glamorous beauty story you read today, but probably the most useful for all time. Having acne-prone skin has worked to my benefit in two strange ways. One: My prescription retinol doubles for 86ing fine lines and wrinkles, keeping me Dorian Gray young! Two: My zits forced me to become skilled at doing my makeup. Still, even with my many (many, many) years of pimple-masking experience, I’ve only now learned some new techniques from makeup artists on how to cover every type of breakout.  When it's a whitehead.  Getty  Start with a clean, dry face (duh). “It’s really important that your concealer has a dry, thickish consistency — almost like a putty,” says makeup artist Mally Roncal, founder of Mally Beauty. “The wetter and more slippery a concealer it is, the harder it is for it to adhere to that mound/bubble. This kind of concealer is usually going to be found in a pot or tube, not in a wand — that type is too thin.” Once you’ve found your spackle, use a small brush, like a precision eyeliner brush, to cover both the whitehead and the red, inflamed area surrounding it. “Be as targeted as possible. You could even use a magnifying mirror,” says Roncal. “You don’t want to cover any of the good skin around the pimple or you’ll create a ‘look at my zit’ bulls-eye.” After application, give the zit a gentle pat with a finger so it doesn’t look tall. Translucent powder can make a whitehead look shiny and white; instead set your concealer with a fluffy brush dipped in a powder foundation that matches your skin tone.  “If the zit refuses to be covered by concealer and is in a favorable place — a chin or where Cindy Crawford’s mole is — I have been known to take a black eyeliner and make it a mole,” says Roncal. “When I first met my husband, I had a ‘mole,’ and a month later he asked me, ‘What happened to your beauty mark?’”  When it's a cystic breakout.  Getty  To best hide these swollen, headless monsters, you need to start with a compress — icy or warm — depending on what feels best on your skin. An ice cube feels good, soothing the soreness, and a face cloth doused with warm (but not hot) water will kill bacteria; both can reduce the inflammation and size of a lesion, thank Zeus. “The problem with cystic zits is they all have different personalities,” says Roncal. “I have iced some, warmed up others — you almost don't know until you meet the zit what it’s going to take to get that sucker to go down.”  This may sound counterintuitive, but stay away from full-coverage foundation and use a combo of tinted moisturizer and lightweight concealer instead. “You don't have to completely cover it up because you’re never going to completely hide it,” says Autumn Moultrie, a makeup artist who has worked with Gabrielle Union and Kerry Washington. “Heavy coverage will make it look worse — bigger. You just want to lessen the obviousness by matching your skin tone as best you can.” When in doubt: “Do a smoky eye and no one will be looking at your zit,” says Roncal.  When it's a flaky dried out mess.  Getty  Sigh. Thanks to the overzealous use of acne meds, your blemish now looks like it has dandruff — double gross. The first step should be to hydrate your skin right away, with a small amount of moisturizer, says Joshua Zeichner, New York City-based dermatologist. But according to Roncal, you can also remove flakes as gently as possible before putting on makeup. “I am a fan of soaking flaky blemishes with a warm, wet washcloth and then using a tweezer (sterilized with alcohol), working it around the zit, gently pulling and trimming.” Don’t reach for the concealer just yet: “In order to make your skin look as fresh as possible, you want to keep the area hydrated with an oil-free moisturizer,” says Moultrie. “You also can use a hydrating mist that has essential oils to make your skin look dewy.” Both products will prep your skin before your regular concealing routine.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,857

In a recent interview with OUT magazine, Franco spoke about his past struggles: “I have a very addictive personality.  “When I was a teenager I got over certain addictions, and that’s when I started acting, at age 17.  “I really threw myself into it, and that became everything, to the point where I didn’t even socialise. And then after, like, 10 years of that, at age 27, I realised, ‘Man, I’m so depressed. On the surface my life seems pretty good — I have a career and everything — but I feel isolated and lonely’.  “I’ve started a new chapter of my life. I was very work-addicted, and addicted to other things — not substances, I got over that a long time ago — but I’ve recently changed my life, and this is part of my therapy,"" he added.  “Most actors come to a point in their lives where they have to reassess what they’re doing and why they’re doing it. And for me, after going back to school and trying to do all these other things, this new chapter, with surfing and dancing, is really about slowing down and trying to focus on fewer things but in a deeper, more quality-filled way.”  Franco also insists that he will continue to act saying: “I’ve got to say, of all the things that I’ve done, and I’ve done a lot, the actual process of directing is the most fun, because you’re in the middle of all these different creative people. But no, I will not stop acting.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,389

Shahidi, who was accepted at every college to which she applied, had to face the same difficult choice of every incoming freshman: where should she spend the next few formative years of her life? But this decision might not have been a hard one for her. One of Shahidi’s mentors—and the author of one of her recommendation letters—was none other than Michelle Obama, Harvard alumna and the mother of incoming Harvard freshman Malia Obama, who will start there this fall after her own gap year.  On Tuesday, Shahidi announced her decision on Instagram with a quote from James Baldwin: “The paradox of education is precisely this—that as one begins to become conscious one begins to examine the society in which he is being educated.”  Shahidi’s passion for education has no doubt been influenced by Obama, a double Ivy League graduate (she attended both Princeton and Harvard Law). During a March interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Shahidi told the late-night host a little more about her special recommendation letter.  “I heard you got a recommendation letter from the First Lady, from Michelle Obama . . . How did you get that?” Kimmel asked the actress, who said she would graduate from high school this year.  “Um, hard work,” Shahidi, said, simply, before adding that she was also especially flattered to receive a recommendation from her A.P. calculus teacher at the Dwight School in New York City.  In truth, some of her hard work has been on the First Lady’s education initiative, Let Girls Learn, which is how she got to know Obama. Yes, this is the same program that the Trump administration is reportedly planning to cut, although the White House denied this is the case in early May.

They also took a mug shot. Miles Teller was arrested early Sunday morning after he was literally falling down drunk and refusing to cooperate with cops ... law enforcement sources tell TMZ.  Teller was partying with a group of guys in San Diego when an officer noticed the actor was having trouble standing on the sidewalk. We're told the cop walked up to Miles and started questioning him, but he quickly became uncooperative.  Our sources say that's when Teller lost his balance and almost fell into a traffic lane. The cop cuffed him, and Miles had trouble standing in one spot.  Now the turning point. San Diego offers a detox program where cops will take someone who is drunk to a center run by volunteers. The center has cots where someone can stay for 4 hours and sleep it off. The cop offered to take Miles there but we're told he refused.  At that point Miles could have been arrested, but cops still took him to the detox center ... hoping he'd cooperate. That didn't happen. We're told he refused to follow directions so the staff rejected him.  At that point, Miles was arrested for being drunk in public ... a misdemeanor.

The vast majority of them already live below the poverty line, on less than three dollars a day. Imagine what that would mean for your family,” she said in a speech. “Here, it means families going without sufficient food; children unable to get medical treatment; young girls vulnerable to early marriage; and many Syrians facing their seventh winter without proper shelter.”  RELATED: All About Angelina Jolie’s Connection to Cambodia That Led to Her Golden Globe Nominated Film  The actress added, “Humanitarian aid is not a long-term solution.

06fc7f80-1657-497f-959b-df7aea3f2075,"In the seven months since his abrupt separation from wife Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt has kept a low profile. It all changed this week when his first interview post the split appeared in GQ.  Pitt had been accused of beating his 15-year-old son Maddox on a plane in September, which prompted Jolie to file for divorce. The FBI and Child Services investigated him for child abuse. He was romantically linked to his Allied co-star Marion Cotillard, which she immediately denied.  The GQ spread, apart from the interview, includes a massive 8-day photoshoot of Pitt, 53, “tumbling through” three national parks, and a music video.  But according to the BBC, it was all a planned move by Pitt to correct his faltering image. In the interview, the actor admitted to having an alcohol problem, and how it might have caused the problems in his life. He said he is undergoing therapy and is on a road to recovery after coming to terms with the “self-inflicted” situation he’s in.  But instead of being called out for his behaviour, which, by his own admission is the reason his family was jarringly “ripped apart” the Internet has sided with him.  An article titled “Why Brad Pitt won the Jolie-Pitt war by throwing himself on his sword” published on E! said, “Throwing caution to the wind - and simultaneously capitalizing on 30 years of goodwill built up in Hollywood - Brad went for it, translating what he’s gleaned from his newfound love of therapy into a painfully self-aware, self-deprecating, oft-poetic and at times rambling discourse on a charmed life that veered off course and what he’s doing to right the ship.”  Vanity Fair said, “Pitt clearly studied the lay-it-all-bare, heart-on-my-sleeve, owning-my-flaws interview section of the post-celebrity-divorce playbook. Learning from his tumultuous year is a theme of the talk, especially regarding the divorce, which is still under way. He comes across candid, remorseful, and keen to let the world know that he’s doing a lot of work on himself.”  And Huffington Post completes the trifecta of acceptance: “People like (Brad) do so much to give a face to the addiction crisis that claims so many lives. Thank you for your honesty, your courage, and your willingness to open up about your recovery.”  The BBC quotes PR guru Mark Borkowski as saying that Pitt would have “Total copy approval, total picture approval, total headline approval,” on the interview.  “But of course the timing is calculated,” Borkowski continues. “The language is calculated. Everything is calculated. And everything is a gamble.”  “A lot of people prefer to stay before the waterline and not do it. He’s taken a massive risk and I can think of many who just wouldn’t go this far.”  Follow @htshowbiz for more  First Published: May 05, 2017 10:06 IST",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,553

fbf025fc-b701-4ca2-8527-43424acf4b43,"HBO has closed deals with four different writers to explore multiple possible spinoffs of “Game of Thrones.”  The premium cable channel says that there is no timeline for development of the projects. “We’ll take as much or as little time as the writers need and, as with all our development, we will evaluate what we have when the scripts are in,” a spokesperson said.  The four writers are Max Borenstein (“Kong: Skull Island”), Jane Goldman (“Kingsman: The Golden Circle”), Brian Helgeland (“Legend”), and Carly Wray (“Mad Men,” “The Leftovers”). Goldman and Wray will each be working individually with novelist and “Game of Thrones” creator George R. R. Martin.  “Game of Thrones” executive producers and showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff will be attached to the four projects, as will Martin, but will not write on any of them.  A spinoff to “Game of Thrones” — the most watched series in HBO history — has been a source of speculation for years. In recent months, HBO executive began to privately acknowledge that the network was searching for writers to develop ideas based on the series and Martin’s best-selling fantasy novels from which it is adapted.  Related ‘Game of Thrones’ Season 7: First Photos  Asked about a possible spinoff last year at the Television Critics Association summer press tour, HBO programming president Casey Bloys said, “We’ve talked about it. It’s something I’m not opposed to. But, of course, it has to make sense creatively. I am not sure that the guys [Weiss and Benioff] can really wrap their heads around it when they’re just about to start production. It’s a pretty intense production. They’re about to start production soon, but I’m open to it. The guys weren’t opposed to it, but there is no concrete plans, or anything like that at this point.”  Season 7 of “Game of Thrones” is set to premiere July 16. Production on the show pushed the premiere of the new season past its usual April start date, in order to capture the weather the producers wanted. The new season will consist of seven episodes. The eighth and final season, which Weiss and Benioff have already begun writing, will be between six and eight episodes.  The Season 6 finale of “Game of Thrones” drew a series-high 8.9 million viewers in overnight numbers —an especially high number given premium HBO’s much smaller viewer base than broadcast and basic-cable nets.

Unlike many Hollywood figures, the “Mad Men” alum does not have a social media presence — and he intends to keep it that way.  “The point of life is not to put dog ears on yourself and post it online for everyone to see,” Hamm said, referencing Snapchat’s popular filters. “It’s fun, it’s adorable, but it’s the visual equivalent of masturbating — there’s no point other than immediate gratification.”  The 46-year-old actor, who split in 2015 from Jennifer Westfeldt, his partner of 18 years, also said during the interview that he does not particularly enjoy being single.

It sucks.”  Hamm, who appears in this summer’s “Baby Driver,” said he would rather be part of a beloved project that touches the zeitgeist like “Mad Men” than become the world’s biggest A-lister.  “We all want to be involved in something that takes hold of the culture and makes people sit up and say, ‘Hey, that’s interesting,'” he said. “Actually, that’s all I ever wanted. I never wanted to be a Tom Cruise type of megastar.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,300

Katy originally listed the sprawling home 13-months ago, but a lack of offers is understood to have resulted in a modest reduction on its original $9.285 million valuation.

7c60a957-7c27-42fe-970a-8da205fc8591,"Taylor Michel Momsen (born July 26, 1993)[1] is an American musician, singer, model, and former actress. She is known for portraying the character of Jenny Humphrey on The CW's teen drama series Gossip Girl (2007–2012) and Cindy Lou Who in the film How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000).[2] She is also known for being the lead singer and frontwoman of the American rock band The Pretty Reckless.  Early life [ edit ]  Momsen was born in St. Louis, Missouri. Her parents are Michael and Collette Momsen and she has a younger sister, Sloane Momsen, who is also an actress. She has Russian ancestry.[3] She was raised Roman Catholic[4] and attended Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic School[5] for elementary school and later Herbert Hoover Middle School in Potomac, Maryland but is now non-religious.[6][7][8] She also studied dance at the Center of Creative Arts in St. Louis.  Momsen was signed with Ford Models at a very young age: ""My parents signed me up with Ford [Modeling] at the age of 2. No 2-year-old wants to be working, but I had no choice. My whole life, I was in and out of school. I didn't have friends. I was working constantly and I didn't have a real life.""[6] She began acting professionally at three years of age in a 1997 national commercial for Shake 'n Bake.[9] She was then cast in The Prophet's Game.  Momsen is included on the list of Unclaimed Coogan accounts for performing children whose partial childhood earnings are mandated to be put in a special fund but who have yet to claim their earnings.[10]  Momsen attended the Professional Performing Arts School in Manhattan for high school alongside Connor Paolo, Gregori Lukas, and Sarah Hyland.[citation needed]  Acting [ edit ]  In 2000, Momsen played the role of Cindy Lou Who in Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, her breakout role. In 2002, she was given the role of Gretel in the motion picture: Hansel and Gretel, as well as Alexandra, the President's daughter, in Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams.  Momsen's career came to a halt for over three years until she received a lead role in the WB series Misconceptions, which never aired. After that, she also appeared in the 2006 film Saving Shiloh. She also auditioned for the title role in Hannah Montana, and was in the top three, but the role was instead awarded to Miley Cyrus—a decision that Momsen was happy with in retrospect.[11] In 2007, she starred in the Walt Disney Pictures film Underdog as Molly and as Jennifer in the movie Paranoid Park, directed by Gus Van Sant.  Beginning in 2007, she played the character of Jenny Humphrey in The CW television series Gossip Girl, based on the book series by Cecily von Ziegesar. Momsen's appearances on the series became increasingly sporadic, and, by the end of the first half of the fourth season, she had only appeared in four episodes. It was then announced that the actress would be scheduled for an indefinite hiatus from the show,[12] which ended with her leaving the series as a regular cast member after the completion of the fourth season in 2011. On August 16, 2011, Momsen told Elle magazine that she had quit acting to focus on her music career.[13] On October 16, 2012, it was reported that Momsen would be returning to Gossip Girl for its final episode, in which she appeared briefly in the wedding sequence.[14][15]  Modeling [ edit ]  In June 2008, at the age of fourteen, Momsen signed to IMG Models.[16][17] She was the face of British fashion chain New Look for its spring/summer 2010 collection.[18] After weeks of speculation about who would be the face of Madonna's 2010 fashion line ""Material Girl"", Momsen was announced on July 15, 2010.[19] A week later, Momsen was announced as the model for John Galliano's new women's fragrance, scheduled to launch in autumn 2010.[20] In 2010, she appeared in a video for Galliano's ""Parlez-Moi d'Amour"" fragrance ad campaign.  Momsen is the face of Samantha Thavasa's handbag line. She has done multiple photoshoots, press events, and commercials.[21]  Momsen appeared on the cover of Page Six Magazine when she was 15 years old in 2009. She also appeared on the February 2010 cover of Seventeen.[22] In October 2010, Momsen wore a pair of platform stilettos, thigh-high stockings, and a holster strapped around her leg for Revolver. She appeared on the cover of FHM's March 2012 edition[23] and FHM ranked Momsen #29 in its 2012 Hot 100 issue.[24] She also made her cover debut for Maxim in the November 2013 issue.[25]  Music [ edit ]  Momsen performing in April 2010  Momsen has said that ""music is where I can be me"",[26] stating that ""acting is easy. I've been doing it for so long and I totally love it. But you're playing a character instead of yourself. Music is more personal because you're writing it and you're involved in every step of it.""[26] At 5 years old, Momsen recorded the song ""Christmas, Why Can't I Find You?"" for the soundtrack to How the Grinch Stole Christmas. In 2002, she recorded the songs ""One Small Voice"" and ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" for the compilation album School's Out! Christmas.  In March 2009, Momsen stated in an interview with OK! magazine that her band The Pretty Reckless had signed a deal with Interscope Records.[27] She played her first tour with her band opening for The Veronicas on their Revenge Is Sweeter Tour in spring 2009.[28] After the tour, Momsen began working with guitarist Ben Phillips, who would soon join the band. Momsen subsequently swapped out her former bandmates. She co-writes songs with Phillips; in addition to lead vocals, Momsen also plays rhythm guitar.  The band's debut album Light Me Up was released on August 30, 2010 in the UK,[29] where it debuted at number 6, as well as at number 18 in Ireland. The first single ""Make Me Wanna Die"" was released on May 30, 2010, while the second single ""Miss Nothing"" which was released on August 23, 2010 peaked at number 39. ""Just Tonight"" was released as the album's third single. Songs from this album have been in the movie ""Kick-ass"" as well as shows like ""The Vampire Diaries"" and ""Gossip Girl"".[30]  Television personality Heidi Montag recorded ""Blackout"", a song written by Momsen. According to Momsen, she wrote the song when she was 8 years old and recorded it as a demo with a producer.[31] Montag released the song as a digital only single, with the music video being directed by her husband Spencer Pratt. Momsen commented about the recording: ""I'm like, okay, dude, you're singing an 8-year-old's words, but that's cool. It's so funny because I didn't shop it or anything and I get this call going, 'Did you write a song for Heidi Montag'? And I'm like, 'What?'"".[31] The track was later included on Montag's debut studio album Superficial (2010).  On July 27, 2011, Momsen announced that the band would be the supporting act for Evanescence during the fall of 2011.[32] Throughout 2012, Momsen and her band toured North America; the second headlining tour, titled the Medicine Tour, began in March 2012 [33] and culminated with supporting dates for Marilyn Manson's 2012 world tour Hey Cruel World... Tour. Momsen also appeared as guest vocalist on the first track of ex Ministry member Paul Barker's 2012 album Fix This.  On November 30, 2012, it was announced that The Pretty Reckless' fourth single ""Kill Me"" would be released on December 11.[34] The track was the last song to be featured in the Gossip Girl series finale.  Momsen cites Kurt Cobain, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Marilyn Manson, Oasis, and Shirley Manson of Garbage as some of her personal influences.[35][36][37]  Going to Hell was released on March 18, 2014.[38] The release marked the band's largest sales week to date and landed at #5 on the Billboard 200 with over 35,000 copies sold in its first week.[39] The success of the record saw Taylor, along with the rest of the band, break records when they became the first female-fronted band to reach No. 1 on the rock radio charts with its first two singles: ""Heaven Knows"" in March 2014 and ""Fucked Up World"" in September 2014.[40] The Pretty Reckless also spent the majority of late 2013 throughout 2014 on tour supporting Going To Hell. In 2014, her band also supported Fall Out Boy in their European leg of the Save Rock n Roll Tour along with New Politics.  Throughout 2015, Momsen continued to record new material for the third Pretty Reckless album. On September 29, 2016, the band released the single ""Take Me Down"", which reached number two on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart.[41][42] The third album, Who You Selling For was released in October 2016.[41]  Discography [ edit ]  Filmography [ edit ]",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1890

10b26308-b1d7-49dc-bfbc-1a90095aff4b,"Despite rumors of a possible breakup, Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes seem to be going strong, hitting the town in New York City on Monday evening for a dinner date.  The pair were spotted pulling up to the trendy TAO restaurant in Midtown for dinner on Monday. Upon arrival, Foxx could be seen acting the perfect gentleman, walking around the black SUV the pair arrived in to give Holmes his hand. The romantic night out comes amid rumors that the elusive couple -- who have never publicly acknowledged their relationship -- may have broken up.  A source recently told ET that rumos of a split are false and that the couple are just ""still very, very private. You’re not going to hear or see every time they’re together because they don’t flaunt their relationship in public.”  BACKGRID  Foxx, 50, and Holmes, 39, have kept their relationship extremely low profile for years. They were first romantically linked back in 2013 -- a year after Holmes' divorce from Tom Cruise -- when they were spotted dancing together onstage at the 4th Annual Apollo in the Hamptons Benefit. Foxx publicly denied their relationship at the time, but evidence began to pile up over the years, whether it was a photo of the pair holding hands in his music studio, a quick dinner date in New York City or a romantic stroll on the beach in Malibu.  The couple got slightly less shy this year, making a rare public appearance together at the Clive Davis and the Recording Academy’s Pre-GRAMMY Gala in New York City.  But, true to form, Foxx, just one month later, yanked off his headset at a celebrity basketball game and abruptly ended an interview when asked about Holmes.

4dcd4934-6b41-4566-afb4-8ea31be2dc86,"James Franco Denies Sexual Misconduct Claims, Saying They're 'Not Accurate'  James Franco addressed the sexual misconduct claims circulating about him on social media Tuesday night, telling late-night host Stephen Colbert that ""the things I heard on Twitter are not accurate."" Colbert had mentioned the criticisms raised Sunday by actress Ally Sheedy in a series of since-deleted tweets — claims that were then followed by separate allegations by multiple women.  ""I have no idea why [Sheedy] was upset. She took the tweet down. I don't know, I can't speak for her,"" he told Colbert toward the end of their interview promoting Franco's film The Disaster Artist. ""The others — look, in my life I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I've done. I have to do that to maintain my well-being. I do it whenever I know that there is something wrong or needs to be changed.""  ""The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate,"" he added, ""but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn't have a voice for so long. So, I don't want to shut them down in any way.""  YouTube  Franco's comments come several days after the Golden Globes award ceremony, where he won for best actor in a comedy or musical. During the broadcast, his evident support for ""Time's Up,"" an initiative seeking to end sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace, prompted disgust from Sheedy and others.  ""James Franco just won,"" Sheedy, whom Franco directed in a 2014 off-Broadway show, said on Twitter. ""Please never ever ask me why I left the film/tv business.""  In an earlier tweet, Sheedy had asked: ""Why is James Franco allowed in?""  Both tweets, which lodged no specific allegations, have since been deleted, but at least two other women posted claims against the actor and director.  Filmmaker Sarah Tither-Kaplan alleged a contract she signed with Franco regarding nudity in two of his films was exploitative, and actress Violet Paley addressed a tweet to Franco, saying, ""Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis & that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17?""  ""A couple weeks ago, James offered me & a few other girls an overdue, annoyed, convenient phone 'apology,' "" Paley later tweeted, adding: ""I don't accept.""  Neither allegation has been independently confirmed by NPR.  Still, the simmering controversy was enough to dissuade The New York Times from holding an event featuring Franco. The paper canceled that event, which had been scheduled for Wednesday.  ""The event was intended to be a discussion of the making of the film, 'The Disaster Artist.' Given the controversy surrounding recent allegations, we're no longer comfortable proceeding in that vein,"" the Times explained in a statement to The New York Daily News.  Franco remains scheduled to make another late-night appearance Wednesday, on Late Night with Seth Meyers on NBC.  In Tuesday night's conversation with Colbert, Franco reiterated his support for ""Time's Up,"" saying he backs the drive for pay equity in the workplace, ""which just means people that are underrepresented — women and people of color, people in the LGBT community — get leadership positions, that they fill all positions that they've been deprived of.""  Then he spoke specifically of the claims against him.  ""The way I live my life, I can't live — if there's restitution to be made, I will make it. So, if I've done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to. I think that's how that works. I don't know what else to do,"" Franco told Colbert.  ""Look, I really don't have the answers"" on the larger issue of sexual harassment, Franco added. ""I think the point of this whole thing is that we listen. ... I'm here to listen and learn, and change my perspective where it's off. And I'm completely willing, and I want to.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,807
ff6abca4-ff14-45f7-83ca-52029decd8c6,"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. She married John F. Kennedy in 1953. When she became first lady in 1961, she worked to restore the White House to its original elegance and to protect its holdings. After JFK's assassination in 1963, she moved to New York City. She married Aristotle Onassis in 1968. She died of cancer in 1994.  Early Life  Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was born on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. Her father, John Bouvier, was a wealthy New York stockbroker of French Catholic descent, and her mother, Janet, was an accomplished equestrienne of Irish Catholic heritage. Onassis was a bright, curious and occasionally mischievous child. One of her elementary school teachers described her as ""a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil."" Another teacher, less charmed by young Jacqueline, wrote admonishingly that ""her disturbing conduct in geography class made it necessary to exclude her from the room.""  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Onassis enjoyed a privileged childhood of ballet lessons at the Metropolitan Opera House and French lessons beginning at age of 12. Like her mother, Onassis loved riding and was highly skilled on horseback. In 1940, at the age of 11, she won a national junior horsemanship competition. The New York Times reported, ""Jacqueline Bouvier, an eleven-year-old equestrienne from East Hampton, Long Island, scored a double victory in the horsemanship competition. Miss Bouvier achieved a rare distinction. The occasions are few when the same rider wins both competitions in the same show.""  Onassis attended Miss Porter's School, a prestigious boarding school in Farmington, Connecticut; in addition to its rigorous academics, the school also emphasized proper manners and the art of conversation. There she excelled as a student, writing frequent essays and poems for the school newspaper and winning the award as the school's top literature student in her senior year. Also during her senior year, in 1947, Onassis was named ""Debutante of the Year"" by a local newspaper. However, Onassis had greater ambitions than being recognized for her beauty and popularity. She wrote in the yearbook that her life ambition was ""not to be a housewife.""  Upon graduating from Miss Porter's School Onassis enrolled at Vassar College in New York to study history, literature, art and French. She spent her junior year studying abroad in Paris. ""I loved it more than any year of my life,"" Onassis later wrote about her time there. ""Being away from home gave me a chance to look at myself with a jaundiced eye. I learned not to be ashamed of a real hunger for knowledge, something that I had always tried to hide, and I came home glad to start in here again but with a love for Europe that I am afraid will never leave me.""  Upon returning from Paris, Onassis transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and graduated with a B.A. in French literature in 1951. After graduating from college in 1951, Onassis landed a job as the ""Inquiring Camera Girl"" for the Washington Times-Herald newspaper. Her job was to photograph and interview various Washington residents, and then weave their pictures and responses together in her column. Among her most notable stories were an interview with Richard Nixon, coverage of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration and a report on the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.  U.S. First Lady  It was at a dinner party in 1952 that Onassis met a dashing young congressman and senator-elect from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy; he ""leaned across the asparagus and asked her for a date."" They were married a year later, on September 12, 1953. Onassis gave birth to her first child, Caroline Kennedy, in 1957. That same year, she encouraged Kennedy to write and, subsequently, helped him edit Profiles in Courage, his famous book about U.S. senators who had risked their careers to stand for causes they believed in.  In January 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the U.S. presidency. Although Onassis was pregnant at the time and thus unable to join him on the campaign trail, she campaigned tirelessly from home. She answered letters, gave interviews, taped commercials and wrote a weekly syndicated newspaper column called ""Campaign Wife.""  On November 8, 1960, Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon by a razor-thin margin to become the 35th president of the United States; less three weeks later, Onassis gave birth to their second child, John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. The couple had a third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy born prematurely on August 7, 1963, but lost the child two days later.  Onassis's first mission as first lady was to transform the White House into a museum of American history and culture that would inspire patriotism and public service in those who visited. ""Every boy who comes here should see things that develop his sense of history,"" she once said. Onassis went to extraordinary lengths to procure art and furniture owned by past presidents—including artifacts owned by George Washington, James Madison and Abraham Lincoln—as well as pieces she considered representative of various periods of American culture. ""Everything in the White House must have a reason for being there,"" she insisted. ""It would be sacrilege merely to 'redecorate' it—a word I hate. It must be restored—and that has nothing to do with decoration. That is a question of scholarship.""  As the culmination of her project, Onassis gave a tour of the restored White House on national television on February 14, 1962.

In addition to the officials, diplomats and statesman who typically populated state dinners, Onassis also invited the nation's leading writers, artists, musicians and scientists to mingle with its top politicians. The great violinist Isaac Stern wrote to Onassis after one such dinner, ""It would be difficult to tell you how refreshing, how heartening it is to find such serious attention and respect for the arts in the White House.

In fact, instead of best men, those who are with the groom on the day are usually called 'supporters'. However, Harry isn't the first royal to change the protocol, as Prince William asked him to be his best men at his wedding to Catherine Middleton back in 2011.  Prince Harry has asked William to be his best man  The couple announced it months before their big day, while Prince Harry and Meghan confirmed the news just three weeks before their wedding on 19 May. According to The Times, William opted for the term as it ""had more relevance to his life than the alternative"". Meanwhile, their father Prince Charles had his younger brothers, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, as his 'supporters' during his wedding to Diana, Princess of Wales in 1981, and Edward had his two brothers as supporters on his own wedding day.

Writing for Australian news website, Honey, an exhausted Juliet Rieden told of how this tour has seen the royal couple gain an international seal of approval, while sending “ her circadian rhythms into meltdown.”  She said: “As a seasoned royal correspondent, I like to think I’m well versed in the madness and mayhem of royal tours but this inaugural Commonwealth love-in with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had surprises at every turn and a pace that has sent my circadian rhythms into meltdown.  “It started with a baby announcement that blind-sided us all.

Bush said he felt compelled to speak out after the president reportedly began telling aides and fellow politicians that the tape was fabricated.  “President Trump is currently indulging in some revisionist history,” Bush said.

View Sample Sign Up Now  “This has hit a raw nerve in me.”  In the 2005 recording, which resurfaced during the final moments of last year’s presidential campaign when it was published by the Washington Post, Trump is heard lewdly bragging to Bush about groping and kissing women without their consent.  Trump, on a hot mic, tells the Access Hollywood anchor about unsuccessfully trying to have sex with a married woman and how “you can do anything” to women “when you’re a star.” He said he was able to “grab them by the pussy.”  After the recording’s release, Trump, then a presidential candidate, issued an apology and dismissed the talk as “locker room” banter.  More recently, Trump has revisited the tape to question whether the voice heard is actually his, according to the New York Times.  Bush, who was fired by NBC after the tape’s release, confirms the voice is undoubtedly Trump’s, but adds that he only recently realized that the talk could be more than “hypothetical hot air from America’s highest-rated bloviator”.  “There were seven other guys present on the bus at the time, and every single one of us assumed we were listening to a crass standup act,” Bush wrote.  His perspective changed when he read an account of 20 women who accused Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior.  One woman’s story, about being pushed against a wall and groped, made “the whole ‘better use some Tic Tacs’ and ‘just start kissing them’ routine real,” Bush said. “I believe her”.

5d5cac74-e16b-49ec-ad51-fc1b774c196e,"Producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd, who also oversaw the last show, will be reteaming with him for the 90th Academy Awards.  Jimmy Kimmel will be back as host of the Oscars when the 90th edition of the annual Academy Awards ceremony is held March 4.  The Academy and ABC announced Tuesday that the late night host will reunite with producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd for the 2018 show.  The trio teamed up for the first time for the most recent Oscar show Feb. 26, and while all three generally got good reviews, their contributions were overshadowed by the last-minute envelope gaffe that resulted in La La Land, and not the actual winner Moonlight, being announced as the best picture victor. As part of the official announcement, Kimmel joked, ""If you think we screwed up the ending this year, wait until you see what we have planned for the 90th anniversary show.""  As for ratings, their maiden effort resulted in a 4 percent drop in viewership from the prior year as the show attracted 32.9 million viewers.  Still, ABC, which was granted a larger advisory capacity about key elements of the show when the Academy renewed its contract with the network through 2028 last summer, was eager to see the host of its Jimmy Kimmel Live! invited back.  “Jimmy, Mike and Jennifer are truly an Oscar Dream Team,” Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in announcing their selection. “Mike and Jennifer produced a beautiful show that was visually stunning. And Jimmy proved, from his opening monologue all the way through a finale we could never have imagined, that he is one our finest hosts in Oscar history.”  Added Kimmel, “Hosting the Oscars was a highlight of my career and I am grateful to Cheryl, [Academy CEO] Dawn [Hudson] and the Academy for asking me to return to work with two of my favorite people, Mike De Luca and Jennifer Todd.""  “It’s not often you get two chances to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience and even more rare to be handed the keys to a party 90 years in the making,” De Luca and Todd offered in a joint statement. “We always thought the idea that anything can happen on the Oscars was a cliche until we lived it.”  ""Our Oscars team this year delivered a show that hit every high note,"" Hudson said. ""Jimmy brought back the essence and light touch of the greatest hosts of Oscars past. Mike and Jennifer's love of movies is infectious and touched every aspect of the show. This is the perfect team to lead us into the ninth decade.""  ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey observed, “After just one year, we can’t imagine anyone else hosting The Oscars. Jimmy’s skillful command of the stage is invaluable on a night when anything can happen — and does. With Mike and Jennifer at the helm, we’re ready for another unforgettable show that will dazzle, delight and, most importantly, honor 90 years of Hollywood’s most prestigious award.”  The early announcement represents something of a break with Academy tradition, which in the past has first seen the Academy president select the show's producers and the producers then pick a host — a process that has sometimes resulted in a protracted search. Boone Isaacs, having completed four successive, one-year terms as president, will be stepping down in July, as the Academy's board of governors elects a new president. But rather than wait for a new president to take over, the Academy is moving forward with plans for next year's show.  The early announcement is not unprecedented, though. In both 2013 and 2014, the Academy announced in mid-April that producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, who first produced the 2013 show, would be returning to produce both the 2014 and 2015 shows. Both the Academy and ABC prefer to have producers who've already cut their teeth on one broadcast returning to handle the next year's show, because it eliminates the learning curve facing new producers and provides for continuity of staffing.  Extending an early callback to Kimmel, De Luca and Todd, ensures that all three will have plenty of time to prepare for next year's show, which doesn't take place until the first Sunday in March so as not to conflict with the closing ceremonies of the winter Olympics, which will be taking place the last weekend of February. Last year, Todd and De Luca were not named to produce the 89th Oscars until early November, and Kimmel wasn't given the hosting assignment until early December. ""I had to be at least eighth [choice],"" Kimmel joked to THR. ""It took so long for them to ask.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,898

15698962-edf4-45da-abd2-5ce6718f0c0d,"LONDON — Ariana Grande sent her love to fans on Tuesday as dignitaries, survivors, first responders and the people of Manchester gathered to mark the anniversary of the concert bombing that killed 22 people. The pop star wrote in a tweet to survivors and the families of victims that she was ""thinking of you all today and every day.""  ""I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day,"" she wrote in a tweet that included a bee, the civic symbol of Manchester.  thinking of you all today and every day 🐝 I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) May 22, 2018  Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton of Libyan descent, blew himself up as fans were leaving Grande's concert at Manchester Arena on May 22, 2017. Twenty-two concertgoers were killed, and police say more than 800 people were left ""with physical and deep psychological injuries."" Grande suspended her Dangerous Woman Tour after the bombing and returned for the One Love Manchester charity concert weeks later, which raised funds for victims of the attack.  Last June, Grande was made an honorary citizen of Manchester after a unanimous vote by the city council. The singer has paid tribute to victims of the attack, including the youngest, Saffie Roussos, who would have turned 9 last July. During Grande's July show in Buenos Aires, the singer reprised her take on ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" which she also performed at One Love. She closed off the song by blowing a kiss and saying, ""Happy birthday, Saffie.""  On Tuesday, across Manchester, residents made defiant statements of unity in the face of extremist violence.  Some laid bouquets of flowers in St. Ann's Square; others left hand-written notes on Japanese maples that have been planted to form a ""Trees of Hope"" trail through the city. One note cited U.S. Episcopal bishop Michael Curry's sermon at Saturday's royal wedding: ""As a clever bishop said 'there is power in love.'""  A girl cries as she looks at at tributes left in St Anne's Square on the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing, in Manchester, England, May 22, 2018. Andrew Yates / REUTERS  Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was a day to ""come together.""  Thousands of people paused outside Manchester Cathedral at 2:30 p.m. for a minute of silence that was observed across the country — including in Parliament, where lawmakers paused their debates and fell still.  Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May joined survivors and emergency workers who responded to the attack for a remembrance service at the cathedral.  A choir sang ""Amazing Grace"" and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" and Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and humanist leaders all addressed the congregation.  On the altar stood 22 lit candles, made from the wax of thousands of candles left in the city's St. Ann's Square in the days after the attack.  William read a passage from the Bible's book of Corinthians, ending: ""Faith, hope and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.""  Robby Potter, who was hit by shrapnel as he waited to pick his daughter up from the concert, said he felt he had to come to the service ""to support the families who have lost people.""  ""We were very lucky, we know how lucky we are,"" he told Sky News. ""It's a case of standing strong. The country stood strong, especially Manchester.""  Later, thousands of people — including a choir of survivors — are due to gather for a concert and sing-song in St. Ann's Square. The event will include renditions of Grande's ""One Last Time"" and ""Look Back In Anger"" by Oasis, which became an unofficial anthem of Manchester after the bombing.  Bells on the city hall and churches will ring out at 10:31 p.m., exactly a year since the bomb exploded.  Police say 100 investigators are still working on the case. The U.K. has issued an arrest warrant for Abedi's younger brother, Hashem Abedi, and is seeking his extradition from Libya — a far-from-straightforward process given that country's political chaos.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,835
916de599-9082-48c7-b15f-5d6f33cf220d,"Fergie triumphantly returned to the stage for the first time since her National Anthem fiasco.  The 42-year-old singer was heavily criticised and mocked after she performed a soulful rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner at the NBA All-Star Game on 18 February (18).  While Fergie admitted she took a ""risk"" with her version, basketball players Stephen Curry and LeBron James, along with audience members Chance the Rapper and Jimmy Kimmel, were seen on camera struggling to contain their laughter during her performance.  Fergie returned to the stage at The Forum in Inglewood, California, on Friday (02Mar18), with an appearance during DJ Khaled's star-studded set at his concert with Demi Lovato.  Khaled introduced Fergie as ""my sister"" from TV talent show ""The Four (Battle for Stardom)"" before the crowd gave her a warm welcome with cheers and applause, and she performed her hits including Fergalicious, London Bridge and Glamorous.  ""@djkhaled @ddlovato incredible show last night!!! Luv u, thank u so much for having me #TellMeYouLoveMeTour (sic),"" Fergie tweeted on Saturday.

a0701a61-50f3-4aaf-a2e3-f31d19497aaa,"Illuminating, strobing, chroming. Whatever you call it, highlighting has become a routine staple in basically everyone’s makeup routine. The bright, shiny sister to contouring, highlighting is the act of applying a light-reflecting color on the planes of your face, such as the tops of your cheekbones, your brow bone, and the bridge of your nose, in order to create the illusion of brightness.  While several high-end brands have cult-favorite, highlighting products in their line-up, their prices aren’t so wallet-friendly.  Giphy  Thankfully, there’s a slew of drugstore products that can keep you looking radiant without going broke — but not all drugstore highlighters are created equal. Some are way too glittery, while others just end up being weirdly chalky. Whether you’re someone who only highlights their face on special occasion or you want a cheekbone strobed so brightly you can see it from space, these are the six budget-friendly highlighters that will give a glow even Jennifer Lopez is jealous of.  Revlon Photoready Skinlights Face Illuminator, $9.99  Revlon  This particular highlighter was a cult favorite over a decade ago, originally known as simply SkinLights, but Revlon took it off the market, breaking several hearts in the process. They brought it back in 2014 due to customer demand, giving it a new name and reformulating it so it has better texture and consistency than the older version. It’s a liquid formula and comes in four shades that you can mix and match together, wear alone, or combine with your foundation for an all-over strobed effect. The liquid formula also makes it easy to mix in with your body lotion to create a glow on your collarbone, shoulders, and legs.  Physicians Formula Nude Wear Touch of Glow Palette, $14.95  Physicians Formula  Some people swear by PF’s Mineral Glow Pearls Powder Palette, a small circular compact with bronze-y “pearls” of color. That one’s great, but we find that it works more like a bronzer, adding warmth more than a glow. The Touch of Glow Palette is a small square compact with four shades of shimmering powder: champagne, pink, light gold, and a soft bronze. You can definitely use them separately, but this product really packs a punch when you swirl all the colors together for a customized glow.  Maybelline Face Studio Master Strobe Stick, $7.99  Maybelline  Honestly, is there anything easier to use than makeup in stick form? Maybelline’s Strobe Stick is basically a crayon for your face. It’s small and only comes in two shades (“Light Iridescent” and “Medium Nude Glow”) but it packs a major punch — a little goes a long way, and you can easily apply a small application and buff it out along more areas of your face with your fingers or a brush. This is a great dupe for NARS’ the Multiple Stick, in terms of formula (not necessarily color). The creamy formula works well with skin’s natural texture, and dries down to a pearlescent glow with a slightly powdery finish. For 10 bucks, you can’t go wrong. Plus, it’s SO easy to travel with.  Black Radiance Artisan Color Baked Bronzer, $4.99  Black Radiance  This is technically a bronzer, but as we said above, highlighting is a technique, so you can use whatever gives you the best look for what you’re going for. It can be tough to find a decent highlighter for darker shades of skin, but this comes in four shades (Gingersnap, Rum Spice, Caramel, and Blackberry, shown above) that will help you achieve a diamond glow. The powder formula is marbleized, mixing together several shades of tones of caramel, gold, brown, and gold for a unique finish. You can also use it wet (we recommend using a makeup setting spray over water for extra staying power), which turns it into a sheer cream-like formula. Be forewarned though: The shimmer factor in this is strong, so it’s not for the weak of heart or for those afraid of a little extra dazzle.  NYX Born to Glow Illuminator, $7.50  NYX  This might easily be one of the most recognizable drugstore highlighters, aside from the aforementioned wet N wild one. NYX’s Born to Glow Liquid Illuminator is basically an IRL Snapchat filter for your skin. It’s easy to find at basically any drugstore and can be used as under or over foundation and/or mixed in with your foundation. Don’t let the name fool you though, as it’s less of a liquid and more of a lightweight cream. It comes in a squeeze tube and is available in four shades: Sunbeam (pale pink pearl), Gleam (golden peach pearl, shown above), Pure Gold (gold pearl), and Sun Goddess (bronze pearl). They can also be mixed together to create your own shade. It also has unimaginable staying power, so if you have oily skin or have issue with your product tending to run, this one’s for you.  wet n wild MegaGlo Highlighting Powder, $3.99  wet n wild  This is the holy grail of drugstore highlighters, if you can find it. It’s so popular that it’s almost always sold out on their website and in most stores. When do you find it, we recommend picking up several, especially since its only four bucks a pop. The formula is a super soft powder that swipes on easily and gives you just the right amount of glow. It’s only available in one shade, a rose gold-tinted tan, but it looks great on nearly all skin tones. It will warm up cooler skin tones and add radiance to deeper ones.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1099
2e801b34-2782-4e6f-8b4b-3c03a831d3c2,"It might seem crazy, but after almost 20 years in the industry, Amanda Seyfried still gets star-struck. ""Andy Garcia just walked by...no big deal, this is just my life,"" she exclaims to me over the phone from London, where she's doing press for the Mamma Mia sequel. However, just one minute later, she shouts over to her co-star, ""Hey!""—before explaining quickly to me that Cher had just came over—""I'm talking about you!"" This really is her life.  For some, summoning enthusiasm for a press tour after two decades in Hollywood—she started in the late '90s as Lucy Montgomery on As the World Turns before her breakout in 2008's Mamma Mia—might prove challenging to say the least. Not for Seyfried, who admits she's been feeling ill that day and is still excited for our chat. That's because filming Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again was one of the most rewarding experiences of her life. Mamma Mia, both the first film and the sequel, really boils down to a story about the relationship between a mother and her daughter. This time, Seyfried relates on a whole different level.    Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Streep in Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again Universal  ""When I filmed the first movie I was in my twenties, falling in love, and just really frivolous. Now I have a daughter of my own and I just relate to Donna (Meryl Streep) that much more.""  The love Amanda Seyfried referenced was with her co-star Dominic Cooper, who played her love interest Skye. The actors dated for three years after filming Mamma Mia. Now 32 years old, Seyfried is married to actor Thomas Sadoski, the father of their one-year-old daughter. Now, Seyfried and Cooper are reunited on screen for the first time since their breakup...as lovers, again.  ""You can't call [your ex] by the pet names you have for them.""  So, does Seyfried have any advice for women who must face their ex at work? ""The number one, most important thing is setting boundaries,"" she shares. ""You can't call each other by the pet names you have for them.""  ""You know, it's very strange having to not be intimate with someone you've had an intimate relationship with,"" she confesses. ""It can be hard but you have to step back and be professional. Dominic and I have such a good relationship that it was easy...but if you don't like your ex, just try to get them fired,"" she jokes.  Amanda Seyfried, Dominic Cooper, and Cher in Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again Universal  But back to Cher, who plays Amanda's on-screen grandmother. The two may be press junket buddies now, but when the film began would you believe it wasn't just the rest of the cast that was intimidated by Cher? Apparently, there's no star too big to feel apprehensive when meeting a new group of people who already click. ""We were all so nervous Cher's first day on set,"" Seyfried tells me. ""But when I finally had my first scene with her she told me how nervous she was to meet all of us. I ended up going up to the rest of the cast and crew and told them all to introduce themselves...to Cher!""  Yeah—this is just Amanda Seyfried's life.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,658

His response to why women are so powerful and why he is surrounded by so many beautiful and powerful women was, “Well, let me tell you, a woman made me a man. I was raised by women. Therefore I understand women, I love to be around women, and I understand the power of women. I think women are the most powerful thing on earth. They know how to deal with things that in no way, shape or form could men deal with. I mean, let’s just start with giving birth, let’s just say.” One of his favourite, powerful and beautiful women? “Someone that I love to be around, and she’s so fun and funny, great personality, drop-dead gorgeous, and she’s a hard worker, it’s Sofia Vergara. I’m very proud of her.” And he talked about another women that he has worked with a bunch and continues to, Jennifer Lopez. “Not only is Jennifer someone that I admire and look up to, but she’s also helped me tremendously in my career.

8873cd5a-7e08-4628-85d5-180e0977ae98,"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Meredith Mandell, Adam Reiss and Daniella Silva  NORRISTOWN, Pa. — Bill Cosby, who once embodied the idealized American father on a wildly popular sitcom, was convicted of sexual assault on Thursday in a high-stakes retrial after a half-dozen women testified that the famed comedian drugged and assaulted them.  The jury found Cosby, 80, guilty on all three counts of aggravated indecent assault against one woman, Andrea Constand, 45, drawing an emotional reaction from his other accusers in the courtroom.  The verdict was one of the first major courtroom victories for the #MeToo movement, which has exposed sexual harassment and misconduct in entertainment, media, politics and beyond.  Upon the reading of the first guilty verdict, several of Cosby's accusers sobbed and shook with joy. Cosby's head was bent slightly, eyes shut.  Although Cosby has faced dozens of sexual misconduct allegations spanning decades, he has been charged criminally only in the Constand case. Constand, a former employee at Temple University in Philadelphia, testified that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his suburban Philadelphia home in January 2004.  Constand maintained her composure as the verdict was read in Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.  Cosby lashed out at prosecutors as they asked Judge Steven O'Neill to revoke his bail, suggesting that he was a flight risk.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele noted Cosby's wealth and said he had a plane.  ""He doesn't have a plane, you asshole! I'm sick of it, you asshole!"" Cosby exclaimed.  Cosby faces a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $25,000 on each count. He remains free on bail until sentencing. But he is unlikely to spend much time in jail.  O'Neill said that because of Cosby's age and his medical condition — his eyesight is poor — ""I am not going to simply lock him up."" Cosby has to surrender his passport and must remain in his nearby home, the judge said.  Lili Bernard, an accuser who once appeared as a guest on ""The Cosby Show,"" the groundbreaking 1980s sitcom that introduced an upper-middle-class black family to American viewers, let out a wail as the verdict was read. She began to cry, and court personnel escorted her from the courtroom.  ""I feel like my faith in humanity is restored,"" she told reporters through tears outside the courthouse.  Cosby's attorneys said in brief remarks that they would ""very strongly"" appeal the verdict. Cosby's first trial ended in a mistrial in June.  ""We are very disappointed by the verdict,"" Tom Mesereau, Cosby's lead attorney, said outside the courthouse. ""We don't think Mr. Cosby's guilty of anything, and the fight is not over.""  Steele lauded Constand and the other accusers for their bravery in standing up to Cosby over the years.  ""The most important person in this is Andrea Constand — 14 years later, it may be easy to forget that she was the first courageous person that stood up in public,"" Steele said during a news conference. Constand stood next to the prosecutors, her hands folded in front of her, but she didn't speak.  ""Her quiet courage and her actions through this have helped victims stand up,"" Steele said. ""I hope and I pray that our actions have shown that we will stand up with those victims.""  Janice Baker-Kinney, who testified that Cosby gave her Quaaludes and sexually assaulted her, told MSNBC after the verdict that ""the relief is overwhelming.""  ""I'm shaking with relief, and I can't stop sobbing,"" she said.  Gloria Allred, a lawyer who represents several of Cosby's accusers, praised the verdict while the women stood behind her, shoulder to shoulder, their arms around one another.  ""I truly hope that his long list of victims will now be able to find some kind of peace,"" she told reporters.  The decision came Thursday afternoon on the second day of deliberations. Earlier, the judge read back part of the testimony of the defense's star witness, who said Constand once said she could frame a ""high-profile person.""  The jury was also read back Cosby's testimony in a deposition he gave in 2005 after Constand filed a civil suit against him. In it, the comedian admitted giving a woman Quaaludes to have sex with her.  Cosby, who has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him, has said the sexual encounter with Constand was consensual. Cosby paid Constand nearly $3.4 million in 2006 to settle the civil case.  The verdict was the dramatic culmination of an 18-year case that spanned two criminal trials and multiple police investigations. Afterward, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the University of Notre Dame both announced that they were rescinding honorary degrees they had bestowed on Cosby, while Temple University, where Cosby received his bachelor's degree in 1971 and where he was a trustee for more than 30 years, said the conviction ""provides additional facts for the university to consider with respect"" to an honorary doctorate it gave him in 1991.  Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden portrayed Cosby as a sexual predator who used his TV image as a man of wholesome values to target women he believed he could silence. Prosecutors called five other women who alleged that Cosby also sexually assaulted them in a manner similar to the way he assaulted Constand.  ""He preyed on Andrea Constand the same way he preyed on all those five women,"" Feden said.  Last month, O'Neill ruled that the additional accusers could testify so the prosecution could try to establish that the assault on Constand fit a pattern or that Cosby knew what would happen when he drugged Constand.  Attorneys for Cosby asked pointed questions about the accusers' histories of drug abuse, criminal backgrounds, personal relationships and sex lives.  Defense attorneys were especially hard on Janice Dickinson, a former supermodel.  Mesereau asked Dickinson whether she had spread false rumors about being pregnant with Sylvester Stallone's child. She said the remark was an honest mistake.  Bill Cosby arrives at court for deliberations on Thursday. Brendan McDermid / Reuters  ""I had sex with two men that month. He wasn't the only contender,"" she said, garnering smiles from the jury.  Defense attorney Kathleen Bliss described Dickinson in closing arguments as a ""failed starlet"" and ""an aged-out model.""  ""It sounds like she has slept with every single guy on the planet,"" Bliss said. ""Is Ms. Dickinson really the moral beacon that women's movements want?""  The defense also suggested that Constand and the other accusers were making false accusations in the hope of gaining fame or fortune.  They repeatedly pointed to the $3.4 million payout that Constand received from Cosby in 2006. And they highlighted Allred's proposal in 2014 to set aside a $100 million fund for victims of Cosby if he was unwilling to waive the statute of limitations to allow his accusers to confront him in court.  Some of the questions and arguments drew scorn from observers in the courtroom.  Bernard, who sat in the courtroom for much of the trial, called the defense's closing argument highly offensive.  ""It was based solely on rape myths, on victim blaming, on victim shaming and on a character assassination of really credible witnesses, of very righteous victims, of victims that were clearly telling the truth,"" Bernard told reporters as the jury deliberated Wednesday.  ""It was just a display of utter misogyny and buffoonery, and you know, I'm just, like, 'Wow, how low can they go?' "" she said.  The #MeToo movement was a cloud over the defense's closing arguments Tuesday, with Bliss telling jurors that they shouldn't allow it to influence their decision.  ""Don't get me wrong — bad things definitely happen. But, ladies and gentleman, not every accusation is true. Your common sense tells you that,"" Bliss said. ""We do have to deal with sexual assault. It's a worldwide problem, just like we do with sexual harassment, pay disparity, social inequality.  ""But questioning an accuser is not shaming them,"" she added.

The former child star, 29, was pulled over about 9 p.m. Saturday in Habersham County, Georgia, about 90 miles north of Atlanta. He was charged with driving under the influence, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana and possession of drug-related objects.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  His girlfriend, Madison Parker, was in the car with him and was also arrested, PEOPLE confirms. She was charged with possession of marijuana, obstruction of law enforcement officers and possession of drug-related objects, according to the sheriff’s office.  Backstreet Boy Nick Carter shared a message to his younger brother on Twitter following news of the incident.  “To my brother: I love u no matter what & if u feel the need to reach for help, I am here and willing to help you get better,” Nick, 37, wrote. “Family isn’t always easy, [but] we’re all here for you.”  Habersham County Sheriff's Office via AP  In a public statement posted on Twitter Sunday night, Aaron made it clear that he didn’t think his brother went about the situation in the right away.  “If my own blood truly cared about my well-being, why wouldn’t he call me directly and have a conversation instead of making this about him through a very public forum?” he said in the statement. “That’s not cool at all to use me for his PR and kick me while I am down. I love my family despite it through thick and thin.”  Nick seemingly responded to the message by retweeting a post by Nick’s wife, Lauren, which read, “Hey @aaroncarter have @itsmadisonp text me your new number since you changed it again!”  Aaron’s rep Jonathan Ward tells PEOPLE the popstar is reachable by his family — “whom he loves” — at any time.  “Nick and Lauren have his number – it hasn’t changed. They last spoke on July 6,” Ward tells PEOPLE exclusively. “He doesn’t feel it was proper, what happened.

According to the statement, Carter said he was at an AutoZone in Georgia to fix a tire that was out of alignment on his car when police officers arrested him “with aggression.”  He added that he has a license for medical marijuana for his anxiety and feels he was marked due to his fame.  “He feels his ‘celebrity’ was targeted and an attorney will be retained in this matter,” the statement said. “The video from AutoZone will prove that Aaron was not in a moving vehicle while arrested and charged with a DUI.”  Medical marijuana is legal in Georgia with a license. However, anxiety is not one of the 14 specific conditions covered.  Allen Berezovsky/Getty Image  The singer was previously arrested for investigation of marijuana possession in 2008.  Carter has previously said he “smokes bud,” but denied drinking or doing any other drugs.  During a candid interview for an episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now? last year, Aaron admitted that he turned to drugs and alcohol to self-medicate for depression he experienced after his parents’ divorce and his time on Dancing with the Stars.  “I started getting really heavy into drinking and was telling people, ‘I’m on a real bad path right now. I need help,’ ” he explained.  In 2011, Aaron checked himself into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California “to heal some emotional and spiritual issues he was dealing with,” his manager at the time, Johnny Wright, previously said in a statement.

e9f2fec2-4571-4096-a1fb-4973ae43ca78,"Everything about Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez‘s relationship points to success, beginning with their respective empires across the categories of dance, music, sports, entrepreneurship and more, all the way to their joint couple name, “J-Rod.” Indeed, it seems that the couple has finally discovered lasting love.  While they have yet to be engaged as Rodriguez confirmed on the Today show this week, The Knot rounds up some of the reasons why this celebrity couple is on the road to lasting love.  Timing Was Everything—And They See It  Both Lopez and Rodriguez have been honest about their past failures with love—previous marriages and engagements included—and why they’re both ready now. “We have to take our time. I’ve made plenty of mistakes in my past,” Lopez previously told Good Morning America. “We’re mature now. We’re grown ups, and we’re going to take our time and we’re going to do things at our own pace.”  On Wednesday, August 1, Rodriguez touched on how age has played into the dynamics of their relationship in a good way. “To be honest, if this happened when we were in our twenties, it would have never happened,” he said. “It was just too much craziness. I wasn’t mature enough. You know, boys, we got to get our dumbness out of the way.”  They Share Similar Life Stages  Rodriguez also explained how they bond over the parallels in their lives. “We’re in our forties. We’re both from New York,” he mused on the Today show. “We both come from Latino backgrounds. We both have two kids. I think we’ve both been through a lot and can really appreciate each other—both the good and the challenges.”  Lopez echoed her boyfriend’s notes about their similar life stages in an interview with Cubby and Carolina in the Morning this week. “I think we’re both in a good place in our lives,” she said on the radio program. “Now at this point in our lives where we both have kids, we both have accomplished certain things in our careers and we’re kinda in that second act of our lives, we really complement each other. It’s like, where I need help, he’s really strong and where he needs help I’m really strong.”  They Sharpen Each Other  With dynamic and thriving careers, both Lopez and Rodriguez continue to look for the next derivative of personal and professional growth. “I’m in a good relationship. I feel like I can say that for the first time, I don’t know, maybe ever,” she previously told Hola! “And not that I didn’t have great relationships, full of love and adventure, but this is the first relationship I’ve been where I feel like we really make each other better. We complement each other, and there’s really pure, true love. Just wanting to support the other person and make them happy. So there’s a different selflessness in the love that’s beautiful and different. And healthy!”  Their Modern Family Loves Each Other  “Honestly it couldn’t be better,” Lopez added to Cubby and Carolina this week. “The four of them are amazingly special kids. I mean, of course I’m going to say that because I’m their mom, but they are and they’re sweet and they’re loving and they deal with us and our lifestyle in such a great way. And they love each other, they get along so good.”  Their Love Story Was Meant to Be  In a detailed Vanity Fair piece, Lopez went into detail about the beginning stages of their romance. In fact, it almost didn’t happen. “It was just one of those things where you feel compelled to do something you wouldn’t normally do,” she recalled. “I almost yelled out ‘Alex,’ but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that… I could literally just have walked away. But I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say ‘Hey.’”  Their first date was equally surprising. “He was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!” she recalled to Vanity Fair. “I think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I’m not. I just listen. So he’s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn’t normally talk about on a first date. I don’t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date.”  Secure your ideal wedding vision by starting with The Knot’s Style Quiz, here.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,955

5dcc3cf5-a494-4cc3-97f3-a40464bcec98,"Jane Lynch is reflecting on the life and death of her former Glee costar Mark Salling following his apparent suicide on Tuesday, January 30.  “It’s been tough. He was a troubled, troubled guy, and he always was,” Lynch, 57, told Us Weekly exclusively at Adopt the Arts’ Annual Rock Gala on Wednesday, January 31. “This is a very sad end to it, but I know that he’s at peace now. He’s in the arms of a beneficent force.”  Lynch and Salling costarred in Fox’s Glee from 2009 to 2015. Shortly after the show ended, Salling was arrested for felony possession of child pornography. He pled guilty just one month before his death and was set to appear in court on March 7.  “I know life was very, very hard for Mark. I think we all do the best we can at the end of the day. I know Mark that did the best he could,” Lynch continued. The Emmy Award winner admitted she didn’t know Salling’s family and really didn’t know him, regardless of working together for six years.  “He was a hard guy to get to know,” she said.  However, she does have a personal memory with Salling she holds close to her heart.  “He took videos of the stages and everything. He was so happy to be coming to work, to be on the show. He wrote a song and videotaped his day being on Glee,” Lynch explained. “Driving into the Paramount lot … at that time he was living on a cot in a little room. It was a big jump for him in his career, and also, he had a job and was in with this group of really great kids. I think he knew that he was breathing rarefied air. There was so much joy and happiness in his musical video that he shot for himself. Fox made him take it down. But it was a sweet, beautiful expression of his joy and being in Glee.”  As Us previously reported, Salling’s estate may not have to pay his victims $50,000 each following the death. “Restitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge … He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,” a source explained.  Salling, who was 35 at his time of death, “knew he would have nothing to come back to after he went to prison,” an insider close to the actor told Us.  With reporting by Nicholas White.

462b8254-161b-4855-97cc-32241b5923b5,"CLOSE Reality TV star Chris Soules appeared in court Monday as his lawyers argued the charge against him should be dropped. Pool video  A Buchanan County judge dismissed a contempt of court charge against former KWWL reporter Elizabeth Amanieh on Thursday. (Photo: Special to the Register)  A judge has dismissed contempt of court charges against a former reporter for an eastern Iowa news station who took video of a court appearance by ""The Bachelor"" star Chris Soules.  Elizabeth Amanieh, a former reporter for KWWL, an NBC affiliate station based in Waterloo, took video of Soules in April 2017 during his initial appearance.  Authorities say Soules was involved in a hit and run in April in Aurora, a small town in Buchanan County, when he rear-ended 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, who was driving a tractor. Soules allegedly left the scene after calling 911. Mosher died in the accident.  Soules was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal car crash, a class D felony. If convicted, he could face as many as five years in prison. His trial is set to begin Nov. 7.  Buchanan County District Court Judge Fae Hoover-Grinde on Thursday dismissed the contempt charge against Elizabeth Amanieh. Hoover-Grinde found prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Elizabeth Amanieh willfully violated another judge's order not to record video of the proceeding, said Amanieh's attorneys, Tom Frerichs and Eric Tindal.  ""For her to recognize that was huge for me because I felt like my voice was finally heard,"" Amanieh told the Register in an interview Monday.  More on the Chris Soules case:  Iowa allows journalists to record video, audio and take photographs if they have prior approval. Prosecutors in the case say Judge Linda Fangman had told Amanieh that only photos could be taken during the trial. But prosecutors said that the reporter used her cellphone to take video of Soules' initial appearance.  Hours after the hearing, the district's chief judge, Kellyann Lekar, signed an order retroactively approving expanded media coverage for the hearing. That order was requested by the media coordinator at KWWL's urging, amid confusion about Fangman's order. KWWL then aired and posted the video.  The Buchanan County Attorney's Office filed a complaint saying Amanieh was in contempt of court.  In a news release, Amanieh expressed relief that the case was dismissed. But she also said KWWL executives asked her to film on her cellphone and later posted the video, though she was uncomfortable with the actions.  ""I only did everything my news director at the time, Shane Moreland, directed me to do,"" Amanieh said in the release. ""I was simply following orders when I received direction from KWWL-TV management to record video on my cellphone. When the judge ... told me she did not want that video to be seen anywhere, I got on the phone and called my boss, telling him I was going to delete the video.""  Amanieh said KWWL management told her not to delete the video and later asked Lekar for permission to use the video.  ""KWWL may have been wrong in ordering me to record video on my phone, but they also took no ownership of their actions,"" Amanieh said in the release. ""Even though I followed the directions of KWWL management, they used me as a scapegoat. Instead of standing beside me, they covered up their own actions at every step.""  When asked if she would pursue legal action against the station, Amanieh said ""as of this moment, we are just looking at our options.""  Jim McKernan, KWWL's vice president and general manager, on Monday took issue with some of the information he's seen reported on the case, but said the station would not comment further.  ""Some of the reporting and some of the opinions as represented so far in the press are not correct,"" he said, declining to elaborate.  Moreland did not immediately respond Monday to a message seeking comment.  Read or Share this story: https://dmreg.co/2O8fZx9",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,756

Nance — who competed on Emily Maynard‘s season 8 of The Bachelorette in 2012 — was found unresponsive in Austin, Texas, on May 28. He was rushed to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. Officials at the time said they did not expect foul play. He was 31.  The report revealed that the man was found with lacerations on his right forearm and neck.  Nance appeared on the ABC reality series when he was 26, working as a rehab counselor, and revealed in his Bachelorette introduction package that he had previously struggled with prescription painkillers abuse.  “I was addicted to prescription pain medicine. It all starts out fun and then somewhere along the road, it just turned into something else. It’s a vicious cycle and it ate away at me for a long time,” he said at the time. “I’m almost two years sober, now, and it’s not that easy — you have to completely change your way of living.”  In the wake of his death, many franchise alums shared kind words about the man, with Sean Lowe calling him “a sweet man with a kind soul,” and Chris Bukowski commemorating him as “a gentle man with a huge heart.”  So sad waking up to the news about Michael Nance. Such a kind heart with so much talent. Sending prayers and love to his family and friends. — Emily MaynardJohnson (@EmilyMaynard) May 30, 2017  “Such a kind heart with so much talent,” Maynard tweeted at the time. “Sending prayers and love to his family and friends.”  Although he didn’t win Maynard’s heart, Nance returned to Austin, where he went on to make music for several years.  Of the troubled reality star, a Bachelorette source previously told PEOPLE that the spotlight of the show had weighed heavily on Nance.  “He was the type of guy who felt things very deeply,” the source said. “Such a sensitive guy. You’ve got to remember that I met him when he was in his mid 20s, so he was pretty directionless. I don’t know that being on TV gave him any further direction. But he had such a good aura.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,524

LOS ANGELES - Adele stood proud with Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lawrence protesting equality for women in America by carrying placards at the 2018 Women's March in Los Angeles on Saturday.  The British pop - star who resides in La La Land with husband Simon Konecki and their five-year-old son Angelo - shared a selfie with the Holiday star and Hunger Games actress with their protest placards as they joined thousands of women speaking out against President Donald Trump and the lack of equality in the US.  The 29-year-old singer says she has raised her little boy to have empathy for the opposite sex.  Speaking about the influence the women in her life have had on her career, the Hello hitmaker captioned the post: ""The most influential people in my life have always been women. My family, my friends, my teachers, my colleagues, and my idols. I am obsessed with all the women in my life. I adore them and need them more and more every day. I am so grateful to be a woman, I wouldn't change it for the world. I hope I'm not only defined by my gender though. I hope I'm defined by my input to the world, my ability to love and to have empathy. To raise my son to be a a good man alongside the good man who loves me for everything I am and am not. I want what's best for people, I think we all do. We just can't agree on what that is. Power to the peaceful, power to the people x #womensmarch2018 (sic)""  The Make You Feel My Love singer joined the likes of Whoopi Goldberg, Scarlett Johansson, Eva Longoria and Reese Witherspoon in standing strong and fighting for their rights and hoping to bring change to the country.

I am changing the things I cannot accept.""  Lawrence's read: ""A woman's place, is in the revolution.""

With HBO exploring five different GoT spinoff concepts, “we’d be lucky to get one that we’re very, very excited about, and we did get that. We’re just starting the search for a director… we have to cast it. We hope to be shooting sometime in the new year.”  HBO ordered a pilot for the untitled prequel last month, with the action set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones. Per the official logline, “the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’ history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend… it’s not the story we think we know.”  In addition to writing the pilot, Goldman (X-Men: First Class) will serve as showrunner, and will join Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin as an executive producer. You’ll have to wait a bit to see it, though: Bloys said earlier this year the prequel won’t debut until at least a year after the original GoT wraps up its final season — which won’t start until the first half of 2019.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,298

db9f9b45-50ea-4550-8bd4-3ad6e16a8d9d,"Now that she's become a celebrity in her own right, Paris Jackson is a modern-day tabloid fixture. With that, unfortunately, comes having every aspect of her life analyzed. Her relationship status and dating life are part of that, and when a recent report surfaced that alleged Jackson was dating three women at once, the daughter of the pop icon Michael Jackson took it upon herself to set the record straight.  After Gossip Cop published a report refuting that Jackson was dating three women at the same time—Cara Delevingne , Ashley Benson , and Caroline D'Amore, according to The National Enquirer —Jackson's rep also denied it all, saying, ""No idea how or why they come up with this stuff. Definitely not true.” Jackson later hopped on Twitter to echo that statement, tweeting, ""I’ve never met miss benzo. Caroline is one of my bestest friends who is **straight** and **married**, and also the mother of my godchild. Cara and I were never officially exclusive, you guys made that up.""  The report, which said “things could get quite nasty if Paris doesn’t choose one of these girls to date exclusively,” is the kind of fan-fiction that has become an annoying reality for celebrities who don't adhere to heteronormative sexuality. Delevingne, who has spoken out about not wanting to be ""pigeonholed"" before, has also dealt with overzealous tabloid coverage of her love life.  Just last month, after Delevingne was seen holding hands with Benson as they walked around New York City wearing matching backpacks, some speculated that the pair were an item. Fueling that rumor, or trolling it, or both, Benson later shared the photo on her Instagram, writing, ""Cute cute cute.""  Loading View on Instagram  As for D’Amore, it's somewhat of a mystery how she became entangled in this rumor. The DJ has been married to her husband, Bobby Alt, since 2012, and the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter, Isabella Viking Alt, back in 2015. As Jackson noted, she's the godmother of their child. The women have flaunted their friendship on social media for quite some time now, with D'Amore recently thanking Jackson on Instagram for her friendship, writing, ""Words don’t do this friendship justice but you know how much I love you. Thank you for supporting me as always @parisjackson."" So take it all with a big grain of salt.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,475

It’s a really interesting message how we all change and shift depending for the situation.”  As for “Descendants 2,” Zimmer was “most excited about the new character, Uma.  “She’s got blue hair and she’s like a pirate,” she said.  “Descendants 2” debuts on July 21 at 8 p.m. ET/PT in an unprecedented simultaneous premiere across six networks: ABC, Disney Channel, Disney XD, Freeform, Lifetime, Lifetime Movies, and branded apps.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,412
50448fd7-afcd-4d48-8057-c53ea8d0712c,"It’s been nearly four months since Tamar Braxton filed for divorce from her husband, Vincent Herbert and since the news broke, rumors of a secret love child and domestic abuse have bubbled over. There was even a social media meltdown. Though the singer is finally ready to clear the air.  Sitting down with the ladies of The View, the Grammy-nominated reality star shared the status of her relationship with Herbert and spilled the tea who fueled allegations that caused her Instagram hiatus.  “I have a regular marriage and in regular marriages just like everyone else, things happen, you know. In my marriage, it was just to a point where I felt like divorce was the only option I had left,” she said. Herbert sat in the audience listening attentively as his former partner continued. “Although we’re in extensive counseling and that is much needed and it always will be, I think the bigger picture of everything is that we have a responsibility to my amazing 4-year-old son, just to raise him in the most comfortable, amazing, loving and secure household that we can—that’s why we don’t live together,” she said.  Braxton filed for divorce in October just a month after she announced that her most recent album, Bluebird of Happiness, would be her last so that she could take time off to work on her marriage. The couple married in November of 2008 and welcomed their only child together, Logan, in June 2013.  Many believed that the timing of the divorce announcement was strictly for ratings to promote the fifth season of the couple’s WEtv reality series, Tamar & Vince but the 40-year-old insists that that is far from the truth.  “I wish I could say that a lot of times I could say it was made up just so I could hide behind the truth sometimes. But in this situation, I absolutely have no reason to lie about my marriage or the things that [are] happening in my marriage for ratings. I think that’s disgusting and I would never sell my soul to the devil like that. It’s not that serious. Marriage is a serious thing for me and for my family.”  Nasty allegations also ensued after news broke that Braxton filed for divorce and was only fueled more when the reality star took to Instagram to accuse Herbert of cheating and getting another woman pregnant.  After learning that it was merely a rumor shared with her by someone she believed was her friend, the Maryland native took a hiatus from the ‘Gram. Although she’s since returned to the social media site, she said the incident taught her a very valuable lesson.  “Here’s the thing about people being in your business. Keep people out your business,” she said before addressing her social media meltdown which prompted her to take a break from Instagram. “It was my fault where I put myself in a position where I opened up the floor for people to give their opinions on my marriage. I have to take responsibility for that. And you also have to take responsibility for telling too much of your business. Because people always feel like they can tell you this, they have a hand in this or ‘oh, girl, did you hear about what happened?’ but not everyone wants to see you happy…I do air my dirty laundry, however, I’ve never been that specific and I should’ve been specific enough to say, ‘well this is what my so-called friends were saying.’”  Herbert joined his estranged wife and business partner on stage to set the record straight about the allegations and made a public vow about his devotion to their family.  “Absolutely not,” he responded when asked if there was a bun in the oven of another woman. And all the other allegations are not true. I’m just not that kind of person. I love this lady with all my heart and I love my family with all my heart and I will never stop fighting for my family and trying to be great.”  As for the future, neither Braxton or Herbert know what it holds but they both make it clear that their main priority will always and forever be the wellbeing of their son.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,808

1e858c07-5491-4fbb-8025-5a6dca1fa418,"Now, after years of unsubstantiated rumors about Louis C.K. masturbating in front of associates, women are coming forward to describe what they experienced. Even amid the current burst of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men, the stories about Louis C.K. stand out because he has so few equals in comedy. In the years since the incidents the women describe, he has sold out Madison Square Garden eight times, created an Emmy-winning TV series, and accumulated the clout of a tastemaker and auteur, with the help of a manager who represents some of the biggest names in comedy. And Louis C.K. built a reputation as the unlikely conscience of the comedy scene, by making audiences laugh about hypocrisy — especially male hypocrisy.  [ Read Louis C.K.’s statement: “These stories are true” ]  After being contacted for an interview this week about the on-the-record accusations of sexual misconduct — encounters that took place over a decade ago — Louis C.K.’s publicist, Lewis Kay, said the comedian would not respond. “Louis is not going to answer any questions,” Mr. Kay wrote in an email Tuesday night.  Neither Louis C.K. nor Mr. Kay replied to follow-up emails in which the accusations were laid out in detail, or to voice messages or texts. On Thursday, the premiere of Louis C.K.’s new movie “I Love You, Daddy,” was abruptly canceled, and he also canceled an appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”  The stories told by the women raise sharp questions about the anecdotes that Louis C.K. tells in his own comedy. He rose to fame in part by appearing to be candid about his flaws and sexual hang-ups, discussing and miming masturbation extensively in his act — an exaggerated riff that some of the women feel may have served as a cover for real misconduct. He has all but invited comparison between his private life and his onscreen work, too: In “I Love You, Daddy,” which is scheduled to be released next week, a character pretends to masturbate at length in front of other people, and other characters appear to dismiss rumors of sexual predation.  At the same time, Louis C.K. has also boosted the careers of women, and is sometimes viewed as a feminist by fans and critics. But Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that when they told others about the incident in the Colorado hotel room, they heard that Louis C.K.’s manager was upset that they were talking about it openly. The women feared career repercussions. Louis C.K.’s manager, Dave Becky, was adamant in an email that he “never threatened anyone.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,501

4974690c-131f-4ad7-a080-ab8cd3644da8,"NORRISTOWN, Pa. -- The judge in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial declared a mistrial Saturday after jurors said they were deadlocked after five days of deliberations.  The jury informed Judge Steven T. O'Neill it was ""deadlocked on all counts"" in a note Saturday morning. O'Neill asked jurors if they were ""hopeless[ly] deadlocked,"" and each stood and agreed they were, CBS News' Vidya Singh reports.  O'Neill called the jury's effort ""one of the more courageous acts, one of the more selfless acts that I've seen in the justice system.""  ""I feel bad for all of you. I really do,"" he said.  Cosby remains free on bail.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said he will immediately retry the case.  ""We will evaluate and review our case. We will take a hard look at everything involved, and then we will retry it,"" Steele said at a press conference Saturday morning. ""As I said in court, our plan is to move this case forward as soon as possible.""  A courtroom sketch shows Cosby in court on Saturday, June 17, 2017. Jane Rosenberg  Andrea Constand, who accused Cosby of sexual assault, smiled and hugged supporters in the courtroom. Constand embraced many of the alleged victims who sat through the trial.  Gloria Allred, an attorney for many Cosby's accusers, said she will continue to pursue legal action.  ""We can never underestimate the blinding power of celebrity,"" Allred said. ""But justice will come... It's too early to celebrate, Mr. Cosby.""  Cosby's defense team declared victory and went on the attack, with spokesman Andrew Wyatt saying that ""Cosby's power is back.""  Cosby's wife, Camille Cosby, slammed prosecutors for bringing the case to court. She issued a statement calling Steele ""heinously and exploitively ambitious."" She also attacked the judge, the accuser's lawyers and the media.  The fast-moving case went to the jury of seven men and five women Monday, on day six of the trial, after closing arguments painted different pictures of what happened between Cosby and Constand at his suburban Philadelphia estate in 2004. But the sequestered jury failed to reach a verdict, pausing a half-dozen times to revisit key evidence, including Cosby's decade-old admissions that he fondled Constand after giving her pills.  Late Thursday morning, the panel announced they were deadlocked, but the judge sent them back to work.  Cosby was charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault, each one punishable by up to 10 years behind bars.  The black comedian once known as America's Dad for his portrayal of kindly Dr. Cliff Huxtable on ""The Cosby Show"" suggested recently that race could have played a role in the case against him. The jury included two black members.  Cosby used his power and fame to violate Constand, an employee of Temple University's basketball program, Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden said in her opening statement. Constand, 44, testified last week that Cosby gave her three blue pills and then penetrated her with his fingers against her will as she lay paralyzed and half-conscious. She denied they had a romantic relationship and said she had rebuffed previous advances from him.  Cosby accuser stands by her story  ""In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen,"" Constand, 44, testified June 6. ""I wasn't able to fight in any way.""  She added: ""I wanted it to stop.""  Defense lawyer Brian McMonagle, however, attacked what he said were inconsistencies in Constand's story, disputed that Constand was incapacitated, and made the case that she and Cosby, who was married, had a romantic relationship. McMonagle said Cosby gave her the cold and allergy medicine Benadryl only after she complained she couldn't sleep.  Constand sued Cosby after prosecutors in 2005 declined to press charges. Cosby testified over a decade ago as part of that lawsuit, eventually settling with her for an undisclosed sum. Cosby didn't testify at the six-day trial. But jurors still heard plenty from him as prosecutors read them excerpts from his 2005 police statement and civil deposition.  The sole witness for the defense was the detective who led the 2005 investigation, Richard Schaffer, who previously took the stand during the prosecution's case. He was questioned for six minutes.  In his hour-and-a half closing statement, McMonagle told the jury that Cosby is a brilliant comedian who ""taught us how to smile,"" reports CBS Philadelphia. He said Constand told a ""stone cold lie,"" reports CBS News' Jericka Duncan -- and that while Cosby cheated on his wife, he didn't commit a crime.  Cosby's wife of 53 years, Camille -- in the courtroom for the first time Monday in the 6-day trial -- was stoic during the defense argument.  McMonagle turned towards Cosby and said, ""When you dance outside your marriage ... and you danced.""  He then pointed at Camille Cosby and shouted, ""And you deserved better.""  McMonagle pointed out that Constand telephoned Cosby dozens of times after the alleged assault. Constand told the jury she was merely returning his calls about the women's basketball squad at Temple University, where she worked as director of team operations and he was a member of the board of trustees.  Andrea Constand arrives during Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa., on Wed., June 7, 2017. Cosby is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Constand at his home outside Philadelphia in 2004. AP  ""This isn't talking to a trustee. This is talking to a lover,"" McMonagle said of one call that lasted 49 minutes. ""Why are we running from the truth of this case -- this relationship? Why? I don't understand it.""  Camille Cosby sat in the front row, across the aisle from Constand, who didn't react to McMonagle's two-hour closing but smiled at the end of it. Camille Cosby left when it was the prosecution's turn.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said in his closing argument Monday that the 79-year-old comedian's decade-old statements corroborate Constand's allegations that he drugged and violated her.  ""Drugging somebody and putting them in a position where you can do what you want with them is not romantic. It's criminal,"" Steele said in his closing argument.  Steele also reminded jurors about a telephone conversation in which Cosby apologized to Constand's mother and described himself as a ""sick man.""  ""This is where all the fancy lawyering can't get you around your own words,"" Steele said.  Bill Cosby arrives for his sexual assault trial with his wife Camille Cosby at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa., Monday, June 12, 2017. Matt Rourke / AP  In his 2005 deposition, Cosby said he obtained several prescriptions for quaaludes in the 1970s and offered the now-banned sedatives to women he wanted to have sex with.  He also said he gave Constand three half-tablets of the cold and allergy medicine Benadryl before the ""petting"" began. Prosecutors have suggested he drugged her with something stronger - perhaps quaaludes.  His deposition was sealed for years until a judge released parts in 2015 at the request of The Associated Press, prompting a new set of prosecutors to take a fresh look at the case and charge him.  Some 60 women have come forward to say Cosby sexually violated them, all but destroying his nice-guy image, but the statute of limitations for prosecution had run out in nearly every case. Constand's case is the only one in which Cosby has been charged.  The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are sexual assault victims unless they grant permission, which Constand has done.

Officers were called after a ""family dispute"" at the home of Harvey Weinstein's daughter on Wednesday as the scandal surrounding the disgraced Hollywood movie mogul continued.  Police called after 'family dispute' at the home of Harvey Weinstein's daughter  Weinsten's daughter Remy (22) made a 911 call concerning her father and his mental state on Wednesday morning.  The movie producer was heard screaming ""you're making it worse"" at his daughter, TMZ reports.  Video footage emerged of the former Miramax boss appearing disorientated as he tried to flag a passing car outside her house.  Harvey Weinstein  The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) confirmed they were called to reports of a ""disturbance"" at the house but said no crime had been committed. Weinstein was not there when officers arrived.  An LAPD spokesman said: ""At 10.37am Los Angeles Police Department officers responded to the 500 block of North Kilkea Drive at the house of Harvey Weinstein's daughter and were there for a disturbance call.  ""Officers arrived and conducted an investigation. It was revealed that there was no crime and it was a family dispute. Officers then left the scene.""  The incident follows a string of sexual harassment allegations being levelled against Weinstein from women who worked with him.  Cara Delevingne  British actress and supermodel Cara Delevingne was the latest star to speak out on Wednesday.  She claimed Weinstein made advances towards her in a hotel room after asking her to kiss another woman.  In a statement posted on Instagram she said she was left feeling ""very powerless and scared"" when he invited her to his hotel room.  She said: ""I was so hesitant about speaking out....I didn't want to hurt his family. I felt guilty as if I did something wrong.  French actress Lea Seydoux  ""I was also terrified that this sort of thing had happened to so many women I know but no one had said anything because of fear.""  Spectre actress Lea Seydoux also joined the ranks of Harvey Weinstein's accusers, saying she had to defend herself after the director allegedly jumped on her and tried to kiss her.  Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow  The French actress, who won the Palme d'Or at Cannes for Blue Is The Warmest Colour, said the movie mogul stared at her ""as if I was a piece of meat"".  Writing in the Guardian, she said: ""We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him.  ""I left his room, thoroughly disgusted. I wasn't afraid of him, though. Because I knew what kind of man he was all along.""  On Tuesday, Weinstein was accused of rape by three women - claims Weinstein ""unequivocally denies"" - and his British wife Georgina Chapman announced she was leaving him.  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which hosts the Oscars, described the sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein as ""repugnant"" and ""abhorrent"" and said on Wednesday that it would be holding a meeting on Saturday to discuss any action to be taken.  The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) also announced it had suspended his membership, effective immediately.  Rose McGowan, another accuser, called for the board of the Weinstein Company to be dissolved following the allegations against its co-founder.  The actress, 44, tweeted a link to the campaign on website ipetitions.com and said: ""Join me in supporting this important cause at iPetitions. DISSOLVE THE BOARD.""  Over 10,000 signatures had been added to the petition by Thursday.  Meanwhile, stars across Hollywood have continued to condemn Weinstein's behaviour.  Ewan McGregor said Weinstein was a ""bully"", Matt Damon said he had been left ""absolutely sick to my stomach"" while Ben Affleck added he was ""saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades"".  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May also spoke out about the scandal on Wednesday.  She said the reports were ""deeply concerning"" as senior politicians called for Weinstein to be stripped of his CBE.  Press Association",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,832

063cae8f-b0e7-4f8f-893e-2973b202ba97,"Mindy Kaling nailed her commencement speech at Dartmouth College’s graduation ceremony in Hanover, New Hampshire, on Sunday, June 10. In her 17-minute address, the 38-year-old, who graduated from the Ivy League institution in 2001, shared practical advice — buy a toilet plunger before you need one — and opened up about life as a single mother.  The Mindy Project creator and star welcomed her daughter, Katherine Kaling, on December 15. She honored her late mom, Dr. Swati Roysircar, by choosing the middle name Swati for her first child. Kaling has not revealed the identity of the infant’s father.  “After my daughter was born in December, I remember bringing her home and being in my house with her for the first time and thinking, ‘Huh. According to movies and TV, this is traditionally the time when my mother and spouse are supposed to be here, sharing this experience with me,’” Kaling told the crowd. “And I looked around, and I had neither. And for a moment, it was kind of scary. Like, ‘Can I do this by myself?’”  The brief moment of panic quickly passed. “That feeling went away, because the reality is, I’m not doing it by myself,” Kaling shared. “I’m surrounded by family and friends who love and support me. And the joy I feel from being with my daughter Katherine eclipses anything from any crazy checklist.”  The Oceans 8 actress urged graduates to not “be scared” if they “don’t do things in the right order” and to remember that life takes unexpected twists.  “I didn’t think I’d have a child before I got married, but hey, it turned out that way, and I wouldn’t change a thing,” she said. “I didn’t think I’d have dessert before breakfast today, but hey, it turned out that way and I I wouldn’t change a thing.”  Kaling, who starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in A Wrinkle in Time, also shared wisdom on self-confidence. “I was not someone who should have the life I have now, and yet I do,” she revealed. “I was sitting in the chair you are literally sitting in right now and I Just whispered, ‘Why not me?’ and I kept whispering it for 17 years; and here I am, someone that this school deemed worthy enough to speak to you at your Commencement.”  She continued: “Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something, but especially not yourself. Go conquer the world. Just remember this: Why not you?

Speaking to Cohen, Zolciak-Biermann continued to deny claims that she is racist — and said racism is only something being magnified by social media.  “This whole racism thing in this day in age is b—.

You know it.”  In an Instagram post on Thursday, Zolciak-Biermann backtracked, writing, “During the last RHOA Reunion episode, I made a comment that confused and offended people. I sincerely apologize. Edited out of context, I understand why my remark angered people.”  RELATED: ‘Close Your Legs to Married Men’: A Brief History of Kim Zolciak-Biermann & NeNe Leakes’ Rocky Friendship  “Racism is a sad reality in the United States,” the reality star continued. “It has been prevalent throughout our country’s history. Let me be very clear, I do NOT support, tolerate or put up with any form of racism, hate or other discrimination. My love for ALL people runs deep – I am open to all and always have been.”  The 39-year-old said she “was heartbroken” when she watched the reunion episode and “saw how my words were taken out of context.”  “My comment that seemingly ‘racism didn’t exist 10 years ago’ was made as part of a larger, emotional 45-minute conversation about how, sadly, social media has become a hub for hate,” she said. “Immediately following my confusing comment, I also said that ‘it’s not as real as it is now’ referring to the power of social media. But those remarks didn’t make the show.”  Zolciak-Biermann reaffirmed her position that social media has amplified racism in the U.S., stating, “Before social media, the public simply observed the news. Now, the public actively participates and has an opportunity to take action – in real time.”  “But this is a double edged sword.

Clearly I’m not having a good week. Adam, of three years, announces he went on a date, and that takes me by surprise. But it’s not as surprising as the passive-aggressive digs my friend continues to make about me. I see you…  Bethenny can invite whomever the hell she wants to Puerto Rico, but could it be that I didn’t express any interest in going because she didn’t express any interest in having me go? I didn’t know she and Dorinda were going until they were already there. While she talks smack about me on the show, I’m saying how proud I am of her. Wow…at this point, I'm just sitting back with popcorn like the rest of you, watching this TV character (who I thought was a good friend) continue to take cheap shots. It’s strange that she would say I have no interest in what is going on in Puerto Rico. I was writing checks. I’d asked her many times how things were going. A good friend of mine works with Michael Capponi, and I connected her and Bethenny.  On the other hand, I really don’t give a damn, because my actions speak for themselves. I won’t bore you here recounting the endless places I’ve been to or the stories I’ve brought back exposing neglect, destruction, and people’s sufferings. I did a story once on the landmine crisis, and the head of the campaign went on to win a Noble Peace prize. I’m not bragging — it wasn’t my prize — but I brought attention to a horrible atrocity, and a good thing happened as a result. It may not be private planes, cargo ships, and cash cards, but it’s something.  I am socially aware and politically active. Even when it is uncomfortable, as you saw last season, when I was part of a large “get out the vote” campaign for Hillary Clinton. I know, I know — I was wrong. Trump won. Sure, it didn’t end as I would have liked (understatement), but I remain committed to the idea that good government will bring about good change. I am also grateful to private citizens like Bethenny who step up to fill in the gaping holes. I just don’t understand why she’s fully committed this season to talking about me as though I’m a Miss America contestant who banged her prom date. Haahaahaaa.  Maybe we’ll find out next week.

573b0097-6518-48e7-9d38-c8d19f446d0d,"Actress Kristina Cohen claims the sexual assault occurred in February 2014.  Actress Kristina Cohen has accused Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick of rape. The television star has denied the claim, saying that he does not know the accuser.  Cohen — who posted the claim on Facebook with details of her emotional state over the past month during the flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood (she called the outpouring ""both triggering and emotionally exhausting"") — alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during ""a dark time in my life."" Her mother was sick with cancer (she died three months after the alleged assault) and she did not have the support system to deal with ""the aftermath of the rape.""  Reached by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night, Cohen detailed the claims she made in her Facebook post. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately corroborated that they were told of Cohen's account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place.  Westwick responded in a statement on Instagram that read, ""I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.""  The incident allegedly occurred at Westwick's home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen said she had been invited to the actor's home by a producer named Kaine Harling, a man she had briefly dated in 2013. The evening took a turn, she claims, when ""Ed suggested 'we should all fuck.'"" Despite wanting to leave, Cohen said she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling ""to smooth everything over"" while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom.  After falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her.  ""I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,"" Cohen alleges. ""I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.""  Shocked and confused, Cohen said she ended up leaving the next morning. ""I was so lost and needed someone to pull me out of there,"" she told THR, adding that Harling had left earlier in the night.  Cohen told her friend Lipman of the encounter and also spoke with Harling, whom she claims blamed her for what happened. She added that Harling told her ""I can’t say anything because Ed will have people come after me, destroy me, and that I could forget about an acting career. Saying there’s no way I can go around saying Ed 'raped' me and that I don’t want to be 'that girl.'""  Cohen continued that she now realizes ""the ways in which these men in power prey on women, and how this tactic is used so frequently in our industry, and surely, in many others."" THR reached out to Harling for comment, but he has yet to respond.  Seeing the flood of stories about everyone from Harvey Weinstein and James Toback to Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner inspired Cohen to share her story of the alleged incident. Cohen, who is from Atlanta, is an actress, writer and producer whose credits include the series Ladies Like Us and the upcoming film Earthwalkers.  ""There is a bigger picture to this — cleaning out the system and creating radical change,"" Cohen told THR. ""I think that's what I'm contributing to. That's the big motivator for having this go out and putting it out there. ... I believe in the message of restoration. This will only make us stronger.""

Frank Andrew Hoover was accused of following the singer's motorcade to the airport, sending Taylor’s father frightening emails that included threats to ""end"" her family, and violating a lifetime protective order against him. After pleading guilty to repeatedly violating the protective order, the stalker was sentenced on Monday to a 10-year probation, according to TMZ , but there are many legal strings attached to make sure that he can no longer harass Taylor.  As part of the conditions of his probation, the stalker must stay one mile away from Taylor and her family, and his location will reportedly be monitored by GPS for at least the first year of his probation. He will also reportedly have to complete psychological testing, attend substance abuse classes, surrender all firearms, and undergo random drug testing. If he does not comply, he will be immediately sent to jail.  Unfortunately, this man is just one of many stalkers that Taylor has had to deal with. Earlier this year, an ""obsessed fan"" claimed to be her boyfriend and that he needed a gun ""to protect her."" And in 2016, another man was arrested outside of Taylor's New York City home after reportedly attempting to climb into the window. The same year, a third man reportedly attempted to break into the singer's Rhode Island house, and in 2017 a fourth man was arrested after he was accused of hanging out in the lobby and on the roof of her NYC apartment and one time ringing the doorbell incessantly for an hour straight.

b0e74c5d-3d4a-40ea-9c99-6b39474fbfb9,"Diagnosis  There's no specific test for Bell's palsy. Your doctor will look at your face and ask you to move your facial muscles by closing your eyes, lifting your brow, showing your teeth and frowning, among other movements.  Other conditions — such as a stroke, infections, Lyme disease and tumors — can also cause facial muscle weakness, mimicking Bell's palsy. If the cause of your symptoms isn't clear, your doctor may recommend other tests, including:  Electromyography (EMG). This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve.  This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve. Imaging scans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) may be needed on occasion to rule out other possible sources of pressure on the facial nerve, such as a tumor or skull fracture.  Treatment  Most people with Bell's palsy recover fully — with or without treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all treatment for Bell's palsy, but your doctor may suggest medications or physical therapy to help speed your recovery. Surgery is rarely an option for Bell's palsy.  Medications  Commonly used medications to treat Bell's palsy include:  Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started.  such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started. Antiviral drugs. The role of antivirals remains unsettled. Antivirals alone have shown no benefit compared with placebo. Antivirals added to steroids are possibly beneficial for some people with Bell's palsy, but this is still unproved. However, despite this, valacyclovir (Valtrex) is sometimes given in combination with prednisone in people with severe facial palsy.  Physical therapy  Paralyzed muscles can shrink and shorten, causing permanent contractures. A physical therapist can teach you how to massage and exercise your facial muscles to help prevent this from occurring.  Surgery  In the past, decompression surgery was used to relieve the pressure on the facial nerve by opening the bony passage that the nerve passes through. Today, decompression surgery isn't recommended. Facial nerve injury and permanent hearing loss are possible risks associated with this surgery.  Rarely, plastic surgery may be needed to correct lasting facial nerve problems.  Lifestyle and home remedies  Home treatment may include:  Protecting the eye you can't close. Using lubricating eyedrops during the day and an eye ointment at night will help keep your eye moist. Wearing glasses or goggles during the day and an eye patch at night can protect your eye from getting poked or scratched.

Massaging and exercising your face according to your physical therapist's advice may help relax your facial muscles.  Alternative medicine  Although there's little scientific evidence to support the use of alternative medicine for people with Bell's palsy, some people with the condition may benefit from the following:  Acupuncture. Placing thin needles into a specific point in your skin helps stimulate nerves and muscles, which may offer some relief.

Write down questions you want to ask your doctor.  Preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time with your doctor. For Bell's palsy, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:  What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?  Are there any other possible causes for my symptoms?  What kinds of tests do I need?  Is this condition likely temporary or long lasting?  What treatments are available for Bell's palsy? Which do you recommend?  Are there alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?

After posting an infographic showing the low number of assaults that are reported, Breslin received a comment that read, “Reported rapes are the only rapes that count.” The 21-year-old actress then candidly explained all the reasons she hesitated to talk about her personal experience.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I did not report my rape. I didn’t report it because of many reasons,” she said. “First off, I was in complete shock and total denial. I didn’t want to view myself as a victim so I suppressed it and pretended it never happened.”  As she was in a relationship with the perpetrator, Breslin was unsure if reporting the incident would cause more issues.  “I was in a relationship with my rapist and feared not being believed,” she wrote. “I also feared that if my case didn’t lead anywhere, he would still find out and hurt me even more.”  She continued, “Third, I knew how hurt my family and friends would be after finding out and I didn’t want to put them thru that.”  Breslin said she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident.

Both have children from previous relationships: Weisz has a 12-year-old son, Henry, with director Darren Aronofsky, while the James Bond star has an adult daughter named Ella, whom he welcomed in 1992 with ex Fiona Loudon.  The then-pregnant star also opened up about the pair’s relationship to the Times, saying, “I’m very happy being married, very, very happy.” She mused of the couple’s reserved nature when it comes to their romance, “We’re just really crap at talking about our private lives.”  Of her pregnancy, the actress said she was “feeling very dodgy for about four months, but now the good bit’s kicked in” during an April interview on Good Morning America.

Update, 4:46 p.m. One of the most eye-popping allegations in Jones’s viral interview has, apparently, been confirmed. Richard Pryor’s widow Jennifer Pryor first tweeted, and then confirmed to TMZ that her husband did, indeed, have a sexual relationship with Marlon Brando, as Jones claimed in his interview. Pryor’s tweet read, “Hey girl: It was the 70's: enough cocaine and good music-one could fuck a radiator and send it flowers in the morning! # noshame“  Ivanka Trump still has yet to comment. The original story continues below.  Quincy Jones used to date Ivanka Trump—or so he says. In a wide-ranging interview with New York magazine’s David Marchese, the music producer casually mentioned, as an aside, that he went on a date with the First Daughter about 12 years ago. Marchese didn’t let that one go.  “He’s a crazy motherfucker,” Jones, now 84, said of Donald Trump. “Limited mentally—a megalomaniac, narcissistic. I can’t stand him. I used to date Ivanka, you know.”  Marchese responded with apparent shock at the new information: “Wait, really?” Back to Jones, who said that 12 years ago, Tommy Hilfiger, who was working with his daughter Kidada, a former model and current designer, told Jones that Ivanka wanted to have dinner with him.  “I said, ‘No problem,’” Jones recalled. “‘She’s a fine motherfucker.’ She had the most beautiful legs I ever saw in my life. Wrong father, though.”  If Jones’s 12-year time stamp is right, that would put his date (he only references one) with Ivanka in 2006, the same year she turned 25 and celebrated alongside actor and then That 70s Show star Topher Grace. It was around this time that Ivanka was rumored to be going on dates with Lance Armstrong. She denied that there was any romance there.  “I have tremendous respect for Lance and all he has accomplished,” she told People. “That said, we are just friends.”  She has not publicly commented on any date with Jones, neither at the time nor since the New York interview was published.

Justin Timberlake took to Instagram on Monday, July 31, to praise his wife, Jessica Biel, for her performance on her new TV series, The Sinner.  “OK, I know I’m not exactly fair and maybe biased here, but my wife’s new show – @thesinnerusa – is amazing,” the 10-time Grammy winner, 36, captioned a trailer for the eight-episode USA Network crime drama. “It’s like nothing I’ve seen her in before, and she’s incredible in the role. You should check it out when it premieres Wednesday on USA. –JT.”  The actress, 35, plays Cora, a young mother living in upstate New York who commits a brutal act of violence against a stranger. The series, which many critics are calling a “whydunit” rather than a “whodunit,” follows Cora and her inner struggles as viewers attempt to decipher whether her crime was motivated. “I just did it. And I don’t know why,” a blood-soaked Cora says in one teaser.  Biel opened up about The Sinner, which is based on Petra Hammesfahr‘s 2008 novel of the same name, during a recent appearance on the Today show. “We are not looking for who, we are looking for why,” she said of the plot. “Why did this seemingly normal young woman who has a family and a child and husband, why did she do this horrific act? … We all as human beings have the possibility to snap and we don’t do it. But what makes us cross the line?”  The 7th Heaven alum also revealed how she’d react if her and Timberlake’s 2-year-old son, Silas, decides to become an actor one day. “It’s hard to say no because I was given so many opportunities and my family was so supportive of everything, even when I was so young. But it’s hard to say yes because it’s such an intense experience,” she said on Today. “It’s a tough business. It’s a ruthless business. I would be hesitant if he was so young.”  The Sinner premieres on USA on Wednesday, August 2, at 10 p.m. ET.

13c1ebdb-3072-485d-b41b-62ed53d2b3cc,"Ask and you shall receive: After a swarm of messages from fans demanding it, HBO announced Big Little Lies is officially returning for a second season. It makes total sense why the network wants to continue this franchise. For one, people loved it: The season one finale brought in a whopping 1.9 million viewers , which is huge for premium cable. It was also a critical favorite, sweeping both the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards. Will lightning strike twice, though? Based on what HBO's released about season two, it seems like yes. The brand has all the ingredients to make a phenomenal second season (including Meryl Streep).  Until then, here's everything we know about Big Little Lies season two:  It's not airing until 2019. Unfortunately, it'll be a while before Madeline Martha Mackenzie and her one-liners are on your screen again. Production on Big Little Lies season two is slated to start in spring 2018.  Most of the original cast is expected to return. HBO has only confirmed Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman at this point. However, the network said in a press release most of season one's cast is expected to return, and negotiations are underway. All the original actresses are said to be receiving significant pay bumps, as well.  Alexander Skarsgård is back too. His character, Perry Wright, was murdered at the end of season one, but TV Line confirms he'll still pop up around Monterrey, California—presumably in the form of flashbacks. Of course, Skarsgård did tell people.com , ""I don’t even know if I’m really dead or not,"" but he was most likely just teasing.  Season two will be just as dramatic (and violent) as the first. In its original release, HBO teased that ""relationships will fray"" and ""loyalties will erode"" in season two. Plus, ""the potential for emotional and bodily injury shall loom."" So that basically means someone's going to get hurt.  There will be seven episodes. Just like season one.  David E. Kelley, the screenwriter who crafted season one, is returning. He'll write all seven scripts for season two, based on a story ideated by Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty.  Andrea Arnold will direct season two. She's directed episodes for some of the best shows on TV, including Transparent and I Love Dick, along with some incredible indie films, like American Honey. She's replacing Jean-Marc Vallée, who helmed all seven episodes in season one and is returning to season two as an executive producer.  Meryl Streep is joining the cast. Which is a huge deal. She'll be playing Mary Louise Wright, the mother of deceased Perry, who comes to Monterrey concerned for her grandchildren.  She's not the only new character, either. Casting is underway for Bonnie's (Zoë Kravitz) parents, Elizabeth and Martin Howard. In addition, there will be a new employee at Otter Bay School who befriends Jane, and together they swap their ""deepest secrets."" Finally, a new socially conscious teacher at Otter Bay, Michael Perkins, will cause drama when his lessons about global warning give Amabella panic attacks. (Can't this girl live for five seconds?)

The sentencing began Tuesday and is expected to conclude on Friday in Lansing, Mich. Nassar faces up to a life sentence, with a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison.  Close to 90 women are slated to read victim impact statements at his hearing this week. But former gymnast and Nassar victim McKayla Maroney — who first shared her story of abuse over Twitter — faces a $100,000 fine if she speaks out. Maroney signed a nondisclosure agreement in December 2016, agreeing to stay quiet about the abuse she experienced as part of a $1.25 million settlement with USA Gymnastics.  Chrissy Teigen, a swimsuit model and TV host, does not want Maroney to remain silent. Teigen tweeted on Tuesday that she would ""be absolutely honored to pay"" the $100,000 fine for Maroney.

9adaa57d-ab85-44c3-a4d4-474c222c68c2,"CBS’ new top programming executives addressed the network’s struggles with onscreen diversity Tuesday — including the recent controversy over the departure of two Asian actors from “Hawaii Five-0.”  “We love both those actors and did not want to lose them,” CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl said at the Television Critics Association press tour on Tuesday. “We made very, very strong attempts to keep them and offered them a lot of money to stick around.”  In June, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park exited “Hawaii Five-O.” As Variety reported at the time, the actors had been seeking equal pay with stars Alex O’Loughlin and Scott Caan, but failed to reach deals with CBS Television Studios, which produces the series.  The departure of the show’s only two series regulars of Asian descent over a salary dispute involving the pay scale of their white co-stars sparked criticism of CBS on social media and in the press.  Kahl did not go into details of the negotiation, saying, “In my mind it was purely a business transaction.” He characterized the departure of veteran actors as natural for a show entering its eighth season. “It’s happened on ‘CSI,’ it’s happened on ‘Grey’s Anatomy,’ it’s happened on ‘Law and Order: SVU.'”  Related Erinn Hayes’ Character to Be Killed Off ‘Kevin Can Wait’ to Make Room for Leah Remini  Kahl appeared at TCA alongside senior executive vice president Thom Sherman. The two fielded multiple questions about the network’s poor record with diversity in front of and behind the camera, with one reporter noting that CBS has failed to put a new series with a female lead on the air for two seasons running.  “We had six pilots with female leads and the way things turned out those pilots were not deemed to be as good as the pilots that were picked up,” Sherman said.  Sherman and Kahl did not handle the development slate that led to the upcoming season’s crop of new shows. Kahl, a 21-year veteran of the network and its longtime scheduling chief, was named CBS entertainment president in May. His promotion came with the departure of Glenn Geller, who stepped down as the network’s top programming executive following a mild heart attack suffered in March. As part of the restructuring, Sherman was recruited from sister network the CW to head programming under Kahl.  Reporters also grilled Kahl and Sherman on CBS’ casting department, which is staffed entirely by white casting directors, and how it has affected the onscreen diversity or lack thereof in CBS’ series.  “I personally don’t think that has anything to do with it,” Kahl said, adding of the casting department, “They’re fantastic at what they do,” and noting that it has “cast many diverse roles in the past.”  Pressed on why the department is staffed entirely by white casting directors, Sherman said, “They’ve been together for a long time. That’s the department as its been. But we are cognizant of the issue. We hear you, and we will be looking to expand the casting department.”  As his predecessors have, Kahl defended CBS’ diversity record and promised it would continue to improve.  “We can debate the pace of the change, but there is change happening at CBS,” Kahl said, noting an overall uptick in diverse series regulars in recent years. “Every single drama on our air has at least one diverse regular character.”  He added, “We said in the past that we’re going to do better, and we are doing better.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,701

In 2017, the loveable Boykin died. He was only 45 years old.  If you ever watched the MTV reality series, then you knew how unpredictably funny the show and he was.  The reality series follows professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek and his bodyguard, Big Black. The two live together in the Hollywood Hills and hatch crazy plans.

In partnership with the World Wildlife Fund and Tiger Beer in efforts to spread awareness of the decreasing population of the tigers in the wild, she is urging her fans to participate in the #3890TIGERS campaign.  VanCamp recently talked to E! News about the campaign, sharing that the number of tigers left in the wild has lowered down to less than 4,000.  ""To put that in perspective, there are more tigers in captivity in the US than are left in the wild—that's not only shocking, it's heartbreaking. These are incredible creatures at the top of the food chain, yet as powerful as they are, they still our need protection,"" the actress told the news outlet.  As to what the goal of this campaign is, VanCamp stated that the organization aims to double the wild tiger population within five years.  She added, ""With Global Tiger Day this Saturday, we really want to raise awareness for our goal to double the wild tiger population by the next year of Zodiac Tiger in 2022. I also happen to have been born in 1986, another year of the Tiger, so to be able to lend my voice to the wild tigers who have none, means a lot to me and brings it all full circle.""  The fans had noticed that the Canadian actress stayed off social media for a while, even removing her profile picture.

In the caption, she also urged her followers to participate in the campaign by deleting their profile pictures, creating tiger-related art, or making a donation to the rangers that are responsible for keeping the tiger safe in the wild.

f71449dd-3fd8-4624-9355-3803b4db91f5,"Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova have been so secretive about their relationship that fans have often wondered if they’re even still together.  But on Monday, the couple put any split rumors to rest after news broke they reportedly welcomed twins — a boy and a girl — over the weekend.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Here’s a look back at their private romance:  2001  The singer, 42, and the former tennis pro, 36, first met when she starred in her future boyfriend’s sexy music video for “Escape.” Sparks flew on set and they began dating shortly after shooting the video, which features Kournikova initially rebuffing his advances. The duo later make out and get hands-y in the bathroom on the sink.  2002  The couple weren’t always so secretive about their relationship. After making their official debut as a couple on the red carpet of the MTV Video Music Awards in 2002, they also coupled up a year later at the Once Upon a Time in Mexico premiere in New York City.  Anna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias Bill Davila/FilmMagic  In true turn of the century fashion, Kournikova showed off rock-hard abs in an all-white belly-baring ensemble with strappy heels while Enrique wore distressed flared denim jeans and a black dress shirt paired with a T-shirt.  2004  The rumor mill went into overdrive about a possible engagement — or wedding — when Kournikova stepped onto the court at the World Team Tennis match with a blindingly large pink diamond ring on her ring finger. She later sported a simple band while out and about.  Anna Kournikova Jason Squires/WireImage  Reports circulated the duo had wed in a secret ceremony in Puerto Vallarta, but sources told PEOPLE at the time the rumors were false.  2006 – 2012  The pair appeared to be going strong for nearly a decade.  In 2006, they sat front and center at the Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Miami Heat game in Miami, posed for photos at Big Pink restaurant and capped off the year with a date at Mauro’s Cafe in December.  Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova Issac Baldizon/NBAE/Getty  And the next year, Kournikova was photographed goofing around in a bikini with Iglesias while they prepared to board a boat in Miami. In December, they jetted to London and once again fueled wedding rumors when Kournikova was snapped with yet another plain band on her ring finger.  Iglesias fueled breakup rumors when he told a Swedish newspaper that the duo had been secretly married but were “now” divorced. “We’re divorced. I am single now, but that’s okay,” he told Aftonbladet. “I don’t mind being alone.”  However, a Kournikova pal told PEOPLE Iglesias was joking, and his rep also confirmed the duo were “still together.”  In 2008, Kournikova told PEOPLE she was “never getting married” but added that “everything is good” between her and Iglesias. Days later, the singer told reporters he had been trying to get his girlfriend to marry him for years. “I always try, but she pays me no attention,” he said as he arrived in the Dominican Republic for a series of concerts.  Though they didn’t attend many public events together for the rest of the decade, the duo were photographed going on dinner dates and vacationing in St. Barts.  The former tennis champ also opened up about hopefully becoming a mother in the future in a 2011 interview with Women’s Health. “I absolutely want to have children, whether I have my own or adopt,” she told the mag. “I love taking care of people.”  In a 2012 interview with Parade, Iglesias reiterated the duo had no plans to wed. “I’ve never really thought marriage would make a difference,” he told the outlet. “Maybe it’s because I come from divorced parents, but I don’t think you love somebody more because of a piece of paper.”  2013 – 2014  In late 2013, reports surfaced that the longtime couple had called it quits. But after the new year, they were photographed spending quality time together on a boat in Miami.  Then in 2014, Iglesias shocked fans by again claiming he and Kournikova had divorced. “I got a divorce three days ago and I wanted to give you guys the exclusive. I’m serious. No, seriously. Don’t laugh,” he told reporters ahead of a performance at the Staples Center that October.  2016  Kournikova proved all was well in 2016 when she posted a photo of her and Iglesias with her brother Allan on her Instagram account.  Over the last few years, Kournikova also began sporting another massive ring — perhaps a yellow diamond? — complete with a matching diamond band.  2017  Sixteen years after they first met, Iglesias and Kournikova reportedly became parents over the weekend. According to TMZ, the couple welcomed a boy and a girl named Nicholas and Lucy. Reps for the musician and athlete did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  “I think she’d be a perfect mother,” Iglesias once told PEOPLE en Español in 2007.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,970
4fb28784-07df-4364-aa3f-0e059b7cad86,"There's a certain assumption that when you pose nude in your younger days, you'd prefer to keep that image embedded forever in the minds of those who saw it.  Throw that assumption out the damn window.  For seven Playboy cover models, at least, there's no time like the present to revisit their former snaps, as they proved in a shoot by Ryan Lowry and Ben Miller for the magazine.  As chief creative officer Cooper Hefner (oh yes, there's a relation) relays in an Instagram video, it is in fact what he gave his mother for Mother's Day.  Turn up your 🔉: We re-created some of our most iconic covers and one our models happened to be @cooperbhefner's mom. Look out for the cover reveal on 6/4. A post shared by Playboy (@playboy) on Jun 3, 2017 at 6:30pm PDT      ""In the spirit of celebrating the women who’ve made Playboy what it is – an exuberant celebration of beauty, sex, and the beauty of sex — we invited seven special Playmates from over the years to come back and recreate their iconic covers. In the process, they remind us that beauty is ageless, sex appeal is timeless and exuberance is eternal,"" notes the article.  And frankly, we couldn't agree more. Take a look, for example, at Kimberley Conrad Hefner (former wife of Hugh Hefner and mom of Cooper, as well as Marston), in her 1988 cover, and today.  Conrad Hefner, who was raised partially in West Vancouver, was 26 at the time of her original shoot — she's now 54 and divorced from Hef, but still has fond memories of her time at the Mansion.  ""There was a common misconception that I put the kibosh on the partying at the Mansion. It had nothing to do with me. The Playmates still came over, but it was nice to have them call and say, ‘Hi! I’m coming up!’"" she told the publication.  Renee Tenison was the magazine's first African-American Playmate of the Year in 1990.  She was 22-years-old at the time, and is now 49.  Of course, it's somewhat ridiculous it took until that point to have any diversity on the cover, but Tenison remembers a different kind of squabble.  ""When I did Playboy, there was a little bit of controversy because I was the first African-American Playmate of the Year and some women were saying I was being objectified. But I said, ‘Well, if you’re pro-choice, shouldn’t I have the right to choose what I want to do?’ .. If you look back, all the big models from Christy Turlington to Naomi Campbell posed nude. I see it as art. Not everybody sees it that way, but that’s how I see it,"" she told the magazine.  Lisa Matthews, billed as the ""all-American girl,"" took on the task in June 1991.  She was 22-years-old at the time (perhaps that's the magic Playboy cover model number?), and is now 48.  Then there's Candace Collins, who has the oldest cover in the bunch.  She was 22 at the time of her December 1979 photo, and is now 60. She started out working at the infamous Playboy Clubs in St. Louis and Chicago, reports Chicago Magazine, and eventually graced two covers and a centrefold.  With the recent rise in popularity of boudoir photography, it probably should come as no surprise that more and more women (and men) are not only willing to take off their clothes in front of a camera, but clamouring for it.

""This gives a whole new meaning to being stabbed in the back!"" she joked in the caption.  And in early June, Miller explained on Instagram that she had undergone the second operation .  Miller first underwent emergency spinal surgery in April after experiencing severe neck pain and weakness in her arm.  Loading View on Instagram  As SELF wrote previously , Miller's pain eventually progressed to paralysis, which then required an emergency surgery to relieve pressure on her spinal cord.  Though her symptoms were initially thought to be caused by a spinal infection, anorthopedic spine surgeon Hooman Melamed, M.D., who is treating Miller, told SELF previously that further testing suggested that she actually had Burkitt lymphoma, a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma affects the lymph system, a part of the body's immune system. Because lymph tissue is found all over the body, this type of cancer can start pretty much anywhere, but it's often found in the stomach, the American Cancer Society explains.  The exact treatment plan for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma depends on the type and location of the cancer but may include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation. Earlier this month, Miller announced that she was starting her third round of chemotherapy and last week indicated that she may be losing her hair as a result.

78a81c83-d286-4020-b8db-ddb9afe96884,"President Trump has acted on his promise to donate $1 million of his personal fortune to charities helping with Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, the White House said.  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed to The Hill that the president cut checks to 12 organizations helping the the Gulf region recover from the monster storm, which devastated swaths of southeast Texas and Louisiana last month.  The Hill confirmed with multiple groups that they received the funds this week.  Sanders announced late last month that the president would give $1 million of his personal funds to hurricane disaster relief. Following suggestions from the public and the White House press corps, on September 6 Huckabee Sanders announced 12 organizations that would receive funds.  ADVERTISEMENT  The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army received the largest portions of the president’s donation – $300,000 each.  Two groups associated with Christian ministries – Samaritan’s Purse and Reach Out America – were promised $100,000 each.    Eight other groups – the ASPCA, Catholic Charities, Direct Relief, Habitat for Humanity, the Houston Humane Society, Operation Blessing, Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies and Team Rubicon – would receive $25,000 apiece, the White House said earlier this month.  The Red Cross, which was slated to receive one of the larger donations from Trump, did not confirm a specific donation, however a spokesperson told The Hill the organization was “grateful to the Trumps for their generous support of our mission.”  Habitat for Humanity confirmed to The Hill the organization had received a check from the president and first lady Melania Trump.  A Habitat for Humanity spokesperson told The Hill the president and first lady thanked the organization in a note for being “on the forefront of rebuilding our Nation and providing a critical helping hand for those in need.”  Disaster relief organizations Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies and Team Rubicon also confirmed to The Hill they received checks from the president and first lady to assist in Harvey relief.  Reach Out America said in a Facebook post two days before the White House announced the recipients that they had received a $100,000 donation from Trump.  “It was a landmark day for Reach Out America when President Donald & First Lady Melania Trump visited First Church of Pearland, TX. The President & First Lady were there to encourage Hurricane Harvey survivors, and then passed out relief supplies. Larry Williamson, founder of Reach Out America received a generous donation of $100,000 from President Trump for ROA,” the organization’s Facebook page said.  The Washington Post’s David Farenthold reported on Wednesday that Direct Relief, which is dedicated to improving “the health and lives of people affected by poverty and emergency,” received a personal check from the president for $25,000.  The Dallas Morning News’ Lauren McGaughy confirmed the animal charity the Houston Humane Society also received a check for $25,000.  The ASPCA, Operation Blessing, and Samaritan’s Purse declined to discuss personal donations.  The Hill has reached out to the Salvation Army and Catholic Charities for confirmation.  Trump’s record for fulfilling charitable pledges is not spotless.  Early in the Republican presidential primaries last year, the real estate mogul vowed to give $1 million of his personal fortune to veterans’ charities, plus an additional $5 million he said he had raised during a fundraiser in Iowa ahead of the state’s caucuses.  But it was revealed months later that Trump had not made good on that pledge, and only donated $1 million to the causes after facing pressure from media.  Since then, however, the president has fulfilled his promise to donate his presidential salary, giving his first quarter pay to the National Parks Service and his second-quarter salary to the Department of Education.  The Associated Press also reported on Friday that nearly eight months after Trump was sworn into office, his inaugural committee still has not fulfilled a promise to donate leftover funds to charities.

5e674c7d-3d88-400f-95e4-5e26536fc7ab,"Who else spent a solid chunk of their formative years unearthing lesser-known tidbits about their favorite celebrities by way of E! True Hollywood Story? Fans of the original docu-series — which saw its heyday during the late-90s, early-2000s era — will probably be pretty pumped to learn that E! True Hollywood Story is coming back, per a recent announcement from the network revealing its current roster of forthcoming programming. On Tuesday, May 1, E! unveiled its plans for a revamp of the popular documentary-style syndicate in a statement, saying,  E! True Hollywood Story will return with a fresh approach and new episodes that dive deep into the most compelling personalities and stories that are shaping headlines.  While E! hasn't released too many details regarding the specifics of its upcoming True Hollywood Story revamp, if its Tuesday statement is any indication, it certainly looks like the reboot series has some serious nostalgia in store for fans of the original show. That being said, per the network's recent statement, E! True Hollywood Story also seems poised to tout some additional contemporary flair — an inevitable byproduct, it would seem, of changing tides in Hollywood, as well as pop culture at large.  Speaking to that point, Amy Introcaso-Davis, the Executive VP of production and development over at E!, called E! True Hollywood Story ""a beloved franchise that has never been more timely and relevant"" in the network's recent statement about its upcoming programming slate. While Introcaso-Davis didn't elaborate on that particular comment, it's not too difficult to understand what she might have been getting at. Given the truth-telling trend that has cropped up across the film and television industry over the last eight months or so (largely in conjunction with the rise of the Time's Up movement), it seems like there's arguably no better time to revive a franchise whose original M.O. aimed to provide viewers with the ""inside scoop"" as to what's really going on in Hollywood.  Just in case anyone out there needs a little brush-up on their THS knowledge, here's a quick history lesson: E! True Hollywood Story kicked off its original run in early 1996 with an hour-long documentary-style episode that delved into the infamous murder of actress and model Rebecca Schaeffer. The show was originally billed for a series of periodic tv specials, though it was quickly picked up as a regular weekly series.  Throughout its proximate near-decade run, E! True Hollywood Story covered a whole host of celebrity-centric topics, including industry scandals, notorious Hollywood mysteries, and ""Where are they now?"" pieces examining the current lives of former child stars. (Anyone else remember that heartbreaking Macaulay Culkin episode?) Besides Culkin, the original series' biopic-like episodes explored the so-called ""behind-the-scenes"" lives of a roster of the era's A-list Hollywood luminaries, including Lindsay Lohan, Drew Barrymore, and Britney Spears, among many, many others.  In its Tuesday statement, the network offered a glimpse (albeit, in pretty broad strokes) into what a revamped episode of True Hollywood Story might look like. Because, while the upcoming revamped series sounds like its going to operate under the same general parameters as the original, E!'s statement said that the new series will be taking a ""modern approach"" to its narratives — a conceivable attempt to do what the network described in its statement as ""providing a voice to the moments that are reshaping popular culture.""  Expanding on that idea a bit, the network also offered a slightly more robust explanation as to how True Hollywood Story's newly-minted episodic structure is going to work, saying,  Each self-contained documentary will explore a topic, headline, or person that became the ground zero for a revolution, change or shift in culture, told by the people who were on the front lines of the story.  At this point, it's difficult to theorize about which buzzing Hollywood-centric topics the upcoming E! True Hollywood Stories revamp will choose to focus on, especially considering the vast scope of potential avenues to pursue. That being said, if the updated docu-series is anything like the original, it certainly seems poised to gift eager viewers with the pop cultural intel they've been craving since 2015 — at least.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,803

A new lawsuit, filed Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accuses the entrepreneur of rape, according to reports from The New York Times and Billboard. The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, is seeking $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, according to the outlets. Simmons denies the charge as well as the other accusations of sexual assault and misconduct.  Per the lawsuit, the woman says she met Simmons, 60, at a concert she attended with her son. After dropping her son off and spending some time together, the lawsuit says Doe hesitantly joined Simmons in his hotel room where she was raped.

23cf1b52-914d-4f3e-8c2c-d6acf72eaafe,"SPOILER ALERT: Do not read on unless you’ve seen Season 7, episode 2 of “American Horror Story,” titled “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” which aired on Sept. 12.  The premiere of “American Horror Story: Cult” found Ally (Sarah Paulson) to be, well, a mess after the election. As Donald Trump is voted into office, her old phobias rear their ugly heads once again, but in the second episode of the season, “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” it only gets much, much worse. In fact, her fears become fatal in the last shot of the episode, one of the most unsettling scenes yet.  But first, we pick up where we left off — with Ally in bed with one of the dreaded clowns. She screams and runs for Ivy (Alison Pill), who rushes to protect her and is as sweet and patient as ever. When she finds no such clown in the bedroom, however, despite Ally’s protests, Ivy admits again that Ally’s anxiety has taken its toll on her. Ally finally resigns to her state, saying, “I think there might be something wrong with me.” (But hey: Just because she’s paranoid, it doesn’t mean someone isn’t out to get her.)  Meanwhile, we see that Kai’s (Evan Peters) nefarious plans from the last episode have been working out swimmingly for him. After he provoked a band of construction workers by yelling racial slurs at them and chucking over a condom full of his urine, they unleashed a beatdown on him… while someone filmed on a cell phone nearby. Now it’s a local news story, and of course it takes a political turn: some of the construction workers have been taken into the custody of ICE. In announcing his run for city council — a seat that was vacated by the murder of councilman Chang — he quotes Trump’s “rapists and criminals” line, yelling, “Look at my face, Michigan!”  Related ‘American Horror Story: Cult’ Cast: Who’s Returning, Who’s Not, and Who’s New 10 Best ‘American Horror Story’ Episodes  Speaking of the Changs, the Mayfair-Richards already have new neighbors. After a rather creepy scene where Winter (Billie Lourd) engages in the most serious pinky swear ever with Oz, vowing to take his fear for him, she allows him to go next door to play with the new residents. Ally and Ivy get home and immediately freak out over this (how have they not fired Winter yet? Seriously?) and rush over to find Oz playing with bees. Yes, in a blatant reference to the “hive mind” theme of this season, one of the new neighbors is actually a beekeeper.  And this also means that Billy Eichner and Leslie Grossman’s characters have been revealed. Harrison and Meadow are married, but not a couple — in fact, Harrison is gay. They just got married based on a pact they made when they were younger. Harrison gets one night a week to go out on the town and satisfy his needs, while Meadow, because of her past case of skin cancer, doesn’t like to be touched, so it all works out pretty nicely for them. They’re a blunt pair, which takes Ivy and Ally aback, but Harrison notes that that’s just “the way of the world now.” Indeed, Harrison.  Ally — surprise! — is skeptical of them, especially of the mysterious barrels they keep at their home, and the fact that they moved into the Chang’s old house so soon after the murders. But she’ll soon learn that they’re the least of her worries. Something’s tripped the alarm system back at their restaurant, and though Ivy offers to go, Ally insists that she can and that she’s “got this.” One has the sense, however, that she does not, in fact, got this. When she gets there, she makes a gruesome discovery: one of her restaurant’s managers hanging from a meat hook, just barely alive. As we learn later, Ally had to be the one to kill him.  Unsurprisingly, there’s an investigation, but there’s a political twist now: a worker at the restaurant is a suspect, due to an argument with the deceased that turned weirdly racial at the top of the episode. When a police officer, played by “AHS” newcomer Colton Haynes, asks Ally and Ivy about his immigration status, Ivy indignantly insists that “he’s American.” Other repercussions of the murder, of course, lie in Ally’s psyche. She gets a gun from Harrison, who has a troubling stockpile of them as he started to collect them, in a sense, when Barack Obama became president. Harrison goads on Ally’s fears, telling her, it’s “the only thing that will make you feel safe again.”  Ivy, concerned, invites Ally’s therapist, Dr. Rudy Vincent (Cheyenne Jackson) for a home call. Here, Ally tells him that she feels “vindicated” by her phobias and that they keep her safe, which… is one way to go. “The world is f—ed up,” she tells him. “The election made it worse.” She shows him her new gun, and while he’s worried, he’s unable to tell Ivy because of doctor-patient confidentiality, Ally notes.  Later, after Ally’s fortified her house, she gets an unwelcome visit from Kai, who she best knows currently as the man who dumped coffee all over her and Ivy in the last episode. He’s making a visit to campaign for office, and in a chilling scene, we see right rhetoric v. left rhetoric in full form. Ally, ironically from behind her newly installed bars, tells Kai that she’s interested in “building bridges, not walls.” Kai asks if he can get a drink of water, and Ally refuses to let him in and threatens to call the cops. Crazed, Kai yells, “It’s so easy until it’s you they’re coming for!”  This does not help Ally’s mental status. Later, as Ivy’s gone at the restaurant, Ally stares reluctantly at her pills. Winter picks up on this — she encourages Ally to have some wine and a bath to unwind, instead of taking her medication. Winter goes so far as to draw a bath for her, and when Ally’s relaxing, she reappears. While Ally is surprised at first, Winter starts to help wash her off. It’s clearly a seduction technique, and it’s kind of genius: she knows Ally’s stressed, and therefore relaxes her into seduction. But nothing ruins the mood like crazed clown murderers.  Suddenly, the power goes out, and with it, so does Winter, exclaiming that she has to go home to save her laptop. Harrison appears at her window to yell one of the best lines of the episode: “Lesbians! We’re under attack!” It’s interesting that he goes political, telling Ally that it could be Russians or “those crazy freaks in North Korea,” seemingly playing on her fears. Ally panics and calls Ivy, who’s dealing with the power outage at the restaurant too. When Ally’s phone dies, Ivy sends Pedro — the employee currently under investigation for murder — with some supplies for her.  Meanwhile, Ally’s lost it. She finds that someone’s cut the cords in her fusebox, and even sees a few of the masked murderers. When she runs upstairs to grab Oz, she has to throw one off of from the top of the stairs (and though it could mean nothing, it’s worth noting: there’s no thump to be heard when the assailant hits the ground). With her gun in hand, she rushes Oz to the door and instructs him to run to the neighbors’ house. When she opens the door, however, someone’s standing there, and in her panic, she shoots him. But lo and behold, it was Pedro there to help her — and now, he could very well be dead.  Now, not only has Ally committed a murder and lost another friend, but my guess is Kai will try to use this to his advantage. Maybe his fear-mongering is working — on Ally, at least.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1672

To treat children in such a cruel manner not only violates their legal rights but also their basic needs,” she said in a statement. “We are doing everything we can to advocate on behalf of the thousands of children who are separated and alone, and we are grateful for the generous support of George and Amal Clooney and the Clooney Foundation for Justice — it could not be more vital at this time.”  John Moore/Getty Images  The Clooneys join a number of other stars who have blasted the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy, which prosecutes undocumented immigrants who cross the border between the U.S. and Mexico. Since implementing the policy, more than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents since April, according to the Associated Press.

Naturally, her eyes -- like her hair -- are brown.  REUTERS  But sometimes, she changes it up.

This eye color phenomenon has been noticed at least as far back as early November, when Esquire questioned Trump's eye color.  Then, press representatives did not respond to Esquire's request for comment on if she wears color-changing contacts, so we just have to go off common sense and say that's what's happening (it's more likely than her eyes spontaneously changing color on opposite sides of the genetic spectrum).  Although some women have said their eyes changed colors over the course of pregnancy -- and Trump was pregnant last year -- that doesn't explain why the color hopped around so much.  Maybe she likes the way it looks and it gives her confidence. Maybe she wants to give off a lighter tone to be more likable (see: all the Disney characters with blue eyes), which, yeah, is a racial thing.

347863fe-b89f-44b0-a06c-a0ed28c59908,"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  For those reeling from a rocky relationship, here’s some advice you can take at face value: get a nose job.  That’s exactly what 28-year-old reality TV personality, Naomie Olindo, decided to do less than half a year after breaking up with heartthrob, Craig Conover. On Thursday, the star of Southern Charm revealed the results of her makeover on Instagram, complete with a nose emoji to further press the point.  Admitting that a bit of swelling was still present in the wake of the procedure less than two weeks earlier, Olindo claimed during an interview on Bravo TV that she decided to take advantage of the show’s post-season hiatus to undergo the procedure. It stated it was something she had wanted to do since she was eight years old. She also said she suffered no pain at all while on the operating table.  Even before she shared the news, fans on social media pointed out that she didn’t quite look the same. However, after commenting on the change, Olindo got a few negative responses and quickly defended her decision. She noted she was happy about the effect of the results on her self-esteem and would do it again.  inquisitr.com  Her rhinoplasty venture might help her move on after splitting from Conover, a relationship that dominated story arcs during seasons three and four of Southern Charm. Olindo originally met Conover in South Carolina at the College of Charleston, but they actually started dating after they graduated.  The most recent season saw the two try to navigate stormy waters as audiences watched their relationship start to unravel, especially when Olindo and Conover underwent therapy to keep their connection from further fraying. Unfortunately, the twosome called it quits in September.  Even after the breakup, Olindo claims she's still the best of friends with Conover, adding that he provided a lot of support for her in a text regarding her nose job.  The two will also remain in the cast of the forthcoming fifth season of Southern Charm, which recently promoted recurring personality Chelsea Meissner to become part of the core ensemble.

7cb450b4-1044-4ba2-a8ed-db99bbc249d7,"Just remember kid... it's all BS. - Robert Mitchum to Nick Nolte at the Academy Awards    I live out here in Hollywood and have had my share of celebrities and their situational ethics and pretentious beliefs. Not all of them, but many at the end of the day, they believe in one thing: Themselves and nothing else or no one else.    Years ago, Hollywood jumped on the Joseph Campbell bandwagon, especially screenwriters, because Campbell mentioned Star Wars and the cottage industry screenwriting gurus incorporated ""Hero's Journey..."" blah, blah, blah and other Joe Campbell lingo into all of their teachings. Robert Mitchum's quote applies.    Thank God! I discovered Joseph Campbell before I truly discovered Hollywood.    Ken Baker weaves an interesting spiritual quest for answers, antithetic to Bill Maher.  His catalyst, which is relatable to most of us, is losing his religion in a hedonistic place like Tinseltown. NBA player Lamar Odom's road to excess is the jumping off point, or ""leap of faith"" that Ken must perform a deep high-dive into his soul. He goes on to tell a stereotypical Catholic upbringing where the family of five attends church and the father goes through the motions to placate the mother, but never honestly embraces God...  An amazing spiritual story evolves from this tragedy.    Ken Baker's an excellent writer and entertaining to read. I burned through his book and enjoyed the spiritual quest alongside him as a reader. As a senior correspondent for E! his job ""is to report on the gamut of entertainment news..."", "" ...as well as the daily hookups, breakups, and screw-ups of the world's biggest stars."" Who better qualified? I ask. You will actually learn something from Ken's book, and it might even contradict what you think about some of the celebrities he interviewed. If you've seen  Thomas Peter ""Tom"" Shadyac's ""I Am"" documentary or most recently Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, then one could view Hollywood as a spiritual sinkhole.    Key takeaway is: Don't discover God on your deathbed. If you chose not to have faith, or find religion a fairly tale, Hey, ""whatever gets you through the night,"" as John Lennon once wrote. Maybe God is George Burns to some people in Hollywood. However, for me, I am personally comfortable with Camus' logic that:    ""I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn't, than live as if there isn't and to die to find out that there is.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,497

Corden joked that he tried to reach Cruise multiple times to cancel.  Before they got in the air, Corden was his usual comedic self, asking Cruise if there was ""meal service"" on the plane and coming up with a hand signal for if he soiled himself. When Corden met the professional that he'd be diving with, Danny, who was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, he said, ""We're not skydiving into Margaritaville, I want someone who looks like they know what they're doing.""

The younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, she began receiving media attention with her appearance as the maid of honour at her sister's wedding to Prince William.  Early life [ edit ]  Pippa Middleton was born at Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Berkshire, England. She is the second of three children born to Michael Middleton (born 1949), a former British Airways flight dispatcher, and Carole Middleton (née Goldsmith; born 1955), a former flight attendant.[7][8] She was christened at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire.[9]  Education [ edit ]  In 1995, her family moved to Bucklebury, Berkshire.[10][11] Like her sister, Middleton was first educated at St Andrew's School, a private boarding school in Pangbourne and then Downe House School, a girls' day and boarding school in Cold Ash. She was a boarder at Marlborough College, where she held a sports/all-rounder scholarship.[12][13] Middleton then graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an English literature degree,[14] where she shared a house with Lord Edward Innes-Ker, a son of the Duke of Roxburghe, and with Earl Percy, heir apparent of the Duke of Northumberland.[14]  Career [ edit ]  Following her graduation, Middleton briefly worked in 2008 at a public relations firm promoting luxury products. She then had an events management job with Table Talk, a company based in London that organises corporate events and parties.[12][15] Also in 2008, Tatler magazine named Middleton ""the Number 1 Society Singleton"", ahead of singer-songwriter James Blunt and Princess Eugenie of York,[16] although in the same Tatler article she was described as someone who ""goes to a lot of parties, but mainly as the caterer."" Since then, she has often been described as a socialite.[17] As part of a duo with her elder sister, Middleton has received wide press coverage, focusing on her social life and her lifestyle. In April 2012, Time magazine listed Middleton as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[18]  Middleton has worked part-time for her parents' company Party Pieces, editing the web magazine Party Times.[12][19]  Penguin Books paid Middleton a £400,000 advance for a book on party planning. The book, entitled Celebrate, was published in autumn 2012, and had lower than anticipated sales as many reviewers mocked it for the obviousness of its content.[20][21] In March 2013, Middleton parted from her literary agent.[22]  The 2016 ITV documentary, Our Queen At 90, revealed that a recipe which featured in Middleton's Celebrate book – Granny's Marrow Chutney – had been made by her sister, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who gave a jar of it as a Christmas gift to her grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, in 2011.[23]  Middleton is also a regular columnist for several publications. She has contributed articles to The Spectator magazine since December 2012[24] and began having a food column in the supermarket magazine Waitrose Kitchen beginning in spring 2013.[25] In June 2013 she was named a contributing editor of Vanity Fair writing a series of columns for the magazine.[26] Beginning in September 2013, Middleton also wrote a fortnightly sports and social column for The Sunday Telegraph.[27] She parted ways from The Telegraph in May 2014.  In May 2013, she became the sole director and shareholder of PXM Enterprises Limited.[28] The company is headquartered at 19 Portland Place in London.[28]  In September 2016, Middleton's iPhone was hacked. The Sun reported it had been approached by a hacker who claimed to have 3,000 images from Middleton's iCloud account and demanded £50,000 for them. The hacker was arrested that same month.[29]  Royal wedding [ edit ]  Middleton stands with the Royal Family as maid of honour at the wedding of her sister and Prince William, as Prince Phillip looks on  The official announcement of her sister's engagement came on 16 November 2010. Middleton served as the maid of honour.[30] At the wedding, Middleton's white figure-hugging dress, which, like the bride's, was created by Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen, was highly praised in the media. Made of ivory crêpe fabric, it was styled with a cowl at the front and organza-covered buttons at the back. Copies of the dress were soon available on the High Street[31][32] where there was a great demand for them.[33][34][35]  Philanthropy [ edit ]  In April 2013, Middleton became an ambassador to the Mary Hare School for deaf children in Berkshire.  In June 2014, Middleton became an ambassador to the British Heart Foundation (BHF).[36] That month, she took part in the Race Across America, a 3,000 mile cycling race across the United States, followed by the Bosphorus Cross-Continental Swimming Race, a 6.5 km swimming competition in Istanbul, as two fundraising opportunities for the BHF.[36] Her bicycle was also auctioned on eBay for the BHF.[36] She then attended the BHF's Roll out the Red Ball at the Park Lane Hotel on 10 February 2015.[37] She auctioned one of her L.K.Bennett dresses at the ball. She took part in the London to Brighton Bike Ride for the BHF on 21 June 2015. In September 2015, Middleton participated in a 47-mile swim-run competition in Sweden alongside her brother and James Matthews to raise money for the Michael Matthews Foundation, a charity found in honour of James Matthew's brother who lost his life on a mountain climbing trek.[38]  In September 2016, Middleton released her second book, Heartfelt, whose proceeds go to the British Heart Foundation.[39]  Personal life [ edit ]  In July 2016, Middleton became engaged to James Matthews, a former professional racing driver, now hedge fund manager. The couple married on 20 May 2017 at St Mark's Church, at Englefield Estate, Berkshire, near Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family home.[40]  Matthews is the eldest son and heir of David Matthews, the Laird of Glen Affric. If Matthews inherits his father's lairdship, then Middleton may be accorded the courtesy title of Lady Glen Affric.[41][42][43][44]  In June 2018, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child.[45][46][47] Their son, Arthur Michael William Matthews, was born on 15 October 2018 at St Mary's Hospital, London.[48][49][50]  Arms [ edit ]  Coat of arms of Pippa Middleton Notes Middleton bears her father's arms on a lozenge.

She got her big break at 14, when she was discovered while vacationing in New York City with her family. She quickly landed a part in the TV series The Bill Engvall Show, followed by roles in films that included The Burning Plain, Winter’s Bone, X-Men: First Class and The Hunger Games. She later reprised her role playing Katniss Everdeen in Catching Fire and the two-part Mockingjay. Lawrence won an Academy Award for her work in David O. Russell 's Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and continued to work with the director on American Hustle and Joy, winning Golden Globes for all three projects as well.  Lawrence was an athletic child, involved in cheerleading, field hockey and softball, and thought she might be a doctor when she grew up. She did some modeling and community theater, but never dreamed that she’d become an actress.  Jennifer Shrader Lawrence was born on August 15, 1990, in a suburb of Louisville, Kentucky. She has two older brothers, Blaine and Ben, and her parents, Karen and Gary, owned a farm just outside the city.  Start of Acting Career  Lawrence’s big break came when she was discovered at 14 while on spring break in New York with her family. A stranger asked to take her picture and took her mother’s phone number, then called the next day to ask her to do a screen test. Things happened quickly after that: Lawrence stayed in New York City for the summer, acting in commercials for MTV and filming the 2007 thriller Devil You Know with Lena Olin. (The film was shelved due to lack of distribution and was eventually released in 2013.) Soon after, Lawrence and her family moved to Los Angeles, where she had small roles on the series Medium, Monk and Cold Case, before landing a part on the TBS series The Bill Engvall Show. While working on the series, she also appeared in feature films including The Poker House and The Burning Plain alongside Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger.  After The Bill Engvall Show was canceled, Lawrence went on to appear in the critically acclaimed Winter’s Bone in 2010, which earned her nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Opportunities continued to pour in, and in 2011 Lawrence appeared in The Beaver with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and Anton Yelchin. She also took on the role of Mystique in X-Men: First Class.  In 2012, Lawrence became a box-office sensation as Katniss Everdeen, the lead in The Hunger Games, the film adaptation of the bestselling novel by Suzanne Collins. Set in a post-apocalyptic state, Lawrence's character must participate in an event in which 24 teens fight to the death as televised entertainment. The film broke box-office records on opening weekend, and Lawrence reprised her role in 2013's The Hunger Games: Catching Fire as well as the two-part Mockingjay (2014 and 2015). As of late 2015, the franchise has earned more than $2.8 billion dollars at the global box office.  'Silver Linings' Oscar  Other 2012 releases for Lawrence included the thriller House at the End of the Street, co-starring Elisabeth Shue, and two dramas with Bradley Cooper: The Falling and Silver Linings Playbook, which earned an array of award nominations and a Golden Globe win (best actress in a comedy or musical) for Lawrence. She took home the Oscar for best actress at the Academy Awards in February 2013. Lawrence seemed overcome with emotion as she accepted the honor.  Lawrence continued to work with Silver Linings Playbook director David O. Russell on 2013's American Hustle, playing the emotionally complex wife of a con artist (Christian Bale). The film co-starred Amy Adams and Cooper. Lawrence received her third Oscar nod for the part, and won her second Globe. In 2014 she co-starred again with Cooper in the little seen drama Serena before once again captivating moviegoers as the mutant Mystique in X-Men: Days of Future Past.  'Joy' and 'Mother'  Lawrence, Cooper and Russell later signed on to bring the story of Miracle Mop inventor Joy Mangano to the big screen, with Lawrence taking on the title role. Joy had a Christmas Day 2015 U.S. release, and Lawrence soon won her third Golden Globe for her performance. Days later she received another Oscar nod. At 25, she became the youngest performer in history to have earned four Academy Award nominations.  Continuing with her high-profile work, in 2016 Lawrence co-starred in X-Men: Apocalypse and the science-fiction film Passengers. The following year she made an impressive leap into the horror genre with the critically acclaimed Mother.

(Photo: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images)  The Wage Gap Essay  In October 2015 Lawrence wrote an essay, which was featured in Lena Dunham's feminist newsletter Lenny, entitled ""Why Do I Make Less Than My Male Co‑Stars?""  Discovering she was paid less than her American Hustle male co-stars via the Sony hacking scandal, Lawrence ultimately blamed herself for not negotiating for more pay.  ""When the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than the lucky people with d*cks, I didn’t get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself. I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn’t want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don’t need,"" she explains.  However, Lawrence admitted she didn't fight for a better salary because she was afraid of how she'd be perceived. ""I would be lying if I didn’t say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn’t want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled,' "" she confessed. ""This is an element of my personality that I’ve been working against for years, and based on the statistics, I don’t think I’m the only woman with this issue. Are we socially conditioned to behave this way? ... Could there still be a lingering habit of trying to express our opinions in a certain way that doesn’t 'offend' or 'scare' men?""  In her own fiery way, Lawrence concluded she would no longer tolerate inequitable pay for fear of being less liked.

""Slow Hands"" peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart and number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Horan's highest-charting single in those countries.  Background and composition [ edit ]  Prior to its release, Horan discussed the song in an interview with Mikey Piff on Sirius XM. The singer said that after listening to some of the material he had recorded for his debut album, he wanted to add ""a bit more grit, funk and heavier bass."" At the time he was listening to late 1970s and early 1980s music. ""When Don Henley went solo in the early eighties, he just kinda had this funky kind of feel to it – heavy bass, heavy guitar – so I just thought, 'Let's give this a crack,'"" Horan said of making the track. ""I wanted it to be a little bit cheeky with the lyric."" About the concept, he explained it is set in a bar and the song's theme changes up stereotypical roles. ""The first line is...'we should take this back to my place' – and usually that's what the guy would say, but we flipped it that the girl would say that, and that's what she said right to my face.""[5][6]  ""Slow Hands"" is a bass-heavy funk-pop song, with Horan singing in a lower register.[5][7] A Billboard writer described it as an ""R&B-inflected rock tune.""[8]  Critical reception [ edit ]  In Billboard, Taylor Weatherby noted ""Slow Hands"" focuses on a ""funkier guitar vibe"", compared to Horan's previous single ""This Town."" She also opined ""the subtly-sexy song"" shows an ""edgier side of Niall.""[9] Colin Stutz from the publication, added, ""The combination of a thumping beat and Horan's raspy vocals makes the song hardly even sound like the same guy who sang [""This Town""]. But what ""Slow Hands"" shows is that Horan definitely won't just be sticking to the sweet singer-songwriter sound on his solo debut.""[6] Rolling Stone's Althea Legaspi also noted Horan ""goes for a more muted sound. Above a stomp-and-clap beat and muted guitar, Horan allows his lower register to showcase his more seductive side on the track.""[5]  In The Irish Times, Jennifer Gannon wrote that ""it’s no radical departure, Niall hasn’t decided to go Gaga but it’s a step in a more Sheeran-style, crowd-pleasing direction. A gentle, foot-stomper about a lady with a magic touch, a lady who knows what she wants, she wants to get her hands all over Niall's ""dirty laundry"" and not in a bringing your washing home on a Sunday way. This isn’t Timberlake’s Sexy Back, it’s Horan’s Sweaty Back.""[10]  Billboard's critics' list placed it second on ""Every One Direction Solo Single, Ranked"" in May 2017, stating that the ""secret"" highlight ""[is] the way Niall's vocal on the first verse is ever so discretely chopped on the recording to a clipped staccato, a mysterious move that forces the singer into a less-is-more delivery that ends up being much more indeed.""[11]  Chart performance [ edit ]  ""Slow Hands"" charted within the top 10 in the charts of Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

And this past weekend, the mother and son had an “amazing” reunion when they were reunited after five weeks spent apart.  Source: Jenelle Evans/Instagram  “It felt amazing to finally be reunited,” Jenelle told E! News about spending time with her oldest child. “He was so happy he didn’t even know what to do first when he got home. I was nervous a little bit because I didn’t want Jace thinking it was me that didn’t want to visit with him, but when he arrived everything was back to the way it used to be.”  Although the mother of three — she is mom to Jace, son Kaiser, 2, and newborn daughter Ensley Jolie — did she some tears, it was a happy reunion.  “I did cry but not around anyone except for David,” said Jenelle, who is engaged to fiancé David Eason. “I didn’t want any of the kids thinking I was upset. Lots of hugs and kisses we’re going around all weekend!”  To celebrate the three-day weekend, the MTV personality and her children, along with Eason’s daughter Maryssa, rode bikes and enjoyed some time hiking and at the beach. “Couldn’t have asked for a better weekend,” she said.  “My next visit with him is this upcoming weekend since his summer school break will begin,” said Jenelle, who will reportedly have Jace for his entire summer break. “We are planning on taking the kids on vacation so that should be lots of fun!”  FROM PEN: What’s Next for Princess Charlotte  Although the Evans v.

5be4f82d-5823-4f04-a00b-23c1957df103,"(CNN) Larry Nassar was sentenced Monday to 40 to 125 years in prison, ending a remarkable three weeks of court hearings that dramatically personalized the pain and suffering the former doctor caused for years.  At his sentencing hearing in Eaton County, Michigan, Nassar apologized for his years of sexual abuse, saying victim statements had ""impacted me to my innermost core.""  ""With that being said, I understand and acknowledge that it pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotions that you all are feeling,"" he said. ""It's impossible to convey the depth and breadth of how sorry I am to each and everyone involved. The visions of your testimonies will forever be present in my thoughts.""  But Judge Janice Cunningham, citing Nassar's earlier claims of no wrongdoing, sentenced him to a lengthy stay in prison and said that he was in ""denial.""  ""I am not convinced that you truly understand that what you did was wrong and the devastating impact you've had on the victims, family and friends,"" Cunningham said.  Nassar had pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal sexual conduct in Eaton County. The sentence was the third in as many months for Nassar, the once-renowned doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. He admitted to using his position as a trusted doctor to sexually abuse young girls under the guise of providing medical treatment.  This Eaton County sentence will run concurrently with the 40-to-175-year sentence in Ingham County , Michigan. He will serve those sentences after a separate 60-year sentence in federal prison for child pornography , meaning Nassar will serve at least 100 years in prison -- an effective life sentence.  ""You will be left to sit there with only the memories of destroying your own family,"" Cunningham said. ""I do not believe that you will have the ability to shut out the words of the children, and the young women and the adults who trusted you and who you let down.  ""That will be your lifetime consequence.""  Powerful victim impact statements  JUST WATCHED Dad lunges at Nassar in courtroom Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dad lunges at Nassar in courtroom 01:52  Nassar's time in court was notable for the passionate, righteous speeches from the survivors of his abuse. Nearly 200 girls and women -- ranging from accomplished Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman to a 12-year-old poet named Amanda on Friday -- spoke out in person or in statements at the Ingham County and Eaton County courts about how Nassar's sexual abuse changed their lives.  ""How much is a little girl worth?"" Rachael Denhollander, the woman who first brought Nassar's abuse to public attention in 2016, asked the court in Eaton County.  ""I am asking you to tell these little girls, tell the young women, tell the watching world, that they are worth everything,"" she told the judge.  The heated atmosphere over the past few weeks culminated Friday when Randall Margraves, a father of three victims, tried to attack Nassar in open court.  Nassar, meanwhile, mostly sat quietly, occasionally shaking his head or wiping away tears. He did not visibly react to the sentence on Monday.  That may be the last time Nassar is heard from publicly, but his impact is far from over . The stunning victim impact statements from the "" army of survivors "" have focused sharply critical attention on the systems of power that protected Nassar for so long.  Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee have denied they helped cover up the abuse. Still, the organizations have seen major leadership shake-ups and face extensive legal investigations into their inner workings to find out who knew what, when they knew it and what they did about it.  ""As detectives, attorneys and survivors have previously noted, a pedophile cannot flourish in the way Larry did in an environment that is not conducive to his behavior,"" abuse survivor Annie Labrie said in court Wednesday.  ""He was prolific because surrounding authorities allowed him to be. Because the gymnastics world allowed him to be.""  How we got here  ""The tables have turned Larry,"" Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman told Nassar in Ingham County court on January 19. ""We are here. We have our voices, and we are not going anywhere.""  As recently as a few years ago, Nassar was widely respected in the gymnastics community and beyond for his treatment of injured athletes. For years, he claimed that his invasive ""pelvic floor"" treatment , in which he put his fingers into young girls' vaginas, was a cure-all that could fix any number of physical injuries.  A number of his victims said they felt violated during the procedure and complained to coaches, trainers or even police. But he was a respected doctor who treated the world's best gymnasts. Their concerns were brushed aside or otherwise dismissed, and Nassar continued to abuse his patients.  In 2014, for example, Amanda Thomashow told Michigan State Title IX investigators and MSU Police that his treatment was really sexual assault. Nassar, who told police he was known as "" the body whisperer "" for his close relationship with patients, said Thomashow simply didn't understand the procedure.  The investigation ultimately cleared him of misconduct, and Nassar returned to abusing patients.  ""I think that the way that my investigation was handled was not in a way to bring out the truth, but instead it was performed in a way to conceal and protect a pedophile,"" Thomashow said  Separately, USA Gymnastics said it became aware of Nassar's sexual abuse in the summer of 2015 when three top gymnasts said he abused them. After several weeks of its own investigation, the organization reported the allegations to the FBI in late July. Nassar was no longer allowed to treat patients at USA Gymnastics, but he continued to abuse young girls at Michigan State amid a slow FBI investigation  That abuse went on until September 2016, when The Indianapolis Star published allegations against Nassar from Denhollander and an unnamed Olympic gymnast. After that first story, more than 50 women reported similar instances of sexual abuse, and Nassar was arrested in November 2016.  The 54-year-old's life since then has been a series of guilty pleas, court hearings and prison sentences.  Nassar pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December . He pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in Ingham County in Michigan and was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison two weeks ago.  ""I've just signed your death warrant,"" Ingham County Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said as she delivered the sentence.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1247

Now, Jamie Foxx is set to head a star-studded telethon to raise even more money to aid Houston citizens to rebuild their lives.  As reported by Entertainment Tonight, Texas native Jamie Foxx recently announced that he will host a telethon to raise money for Houston’s Hurricane Harvey relief and many of his celebrity friends will join in to help as well.

2d33883f-3798-4a9c-a260-5fe04b05c7b2,"Pop star David Cassidy has been hospitalized in Florida and is suffering from organ failure, according to his publicist.  The 67-year-old David Cassidy has previously admitted he was stricken with dementia, but now his liver and kidneys are failing, according to his publicist, JoAnn Geffen. She confirmed his hospitalization, noting, “he is now conscious and surrounded by family.”  Reports indicate Cassidy has been hospitalized for three days and is in critical condition. He has been in declining health for a while and has been open about his prior financial and health problems.  Cassidy, the star of The Partridge Family television show, last performed in March at the B.B. King Blues Club & Grill in New York.  The singer is suffering from kidney failure and needs a liver transplant, according to at least one report. Cassidy’s health has been in decline for more than two months, and his family has been told to prepare for the worst.  Cassidy revealed his dementia diagnosis earlier this year. He has also been open about his struggles with alcohol and drug addition.  In February, he was a guest on the Dr. Phil show, and talked about falling on stage and forgetting the lyrics to one of his songs during an Agoura Hills, Calif. performance.  “When friends of yours or family members begin to say to you, ‘Remember, I just told you this two days ago,’ and there’s no memory of it, that’s when I began to be very concerned,” he said on the show.  Cassidy was arrested for three DUIs since 2010. A judge ordered him to rehab in 2014.  Cassidy, who comes from a show business family (father Jack Cassidy was an actor, and stepmother Shirley Jones starred with him on The Partridge Family), skyrocketed to fame for his role as Keith Partridge on the 1970s sitcom The Partridge Family, which aired from 1970-1974. He became a teen idol, fueling his fame with such heart-throb pop hits as I Think I Love You.  After that hit, Cassidy strove to become respected as a musician, and managed to produce the hit Cherish, which reached number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the UK pop charts. He went on to produce five solo albums during the series run, as well as ten credited to The Partridge Family, most of them million-sellers. Cassidy was also a major concert attraction, playing stadiums and arena-sized shows.  Cassidy struggled with his image as a frothy pop star, coming to grips with it and embracing it later in life. However, as he matured and his past glories faded, the ensuing years were not kind financially. The former star declared bankruptcy in 2015, blaming diminishing royalty checks for The Partridge Family, health issues that prevented him from touring, and bad investments.  The bankruptcy documents claimed: “While he still loves performing for his fans, it is more difficult to travel and perform in various parts of the United States or worldwide due to his health.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,572

Now, the singer is reflecting on her time on the show, and the lasting impact her childhood stardom has had on her.  “I liked being in the Disney universe ’cause I didn’t know anything else,"" she tells correspondent Anthony Mason in a new interview with CBS Sunday Morning. ""I knew I was getting to live what I wanted to do. I think now that I’m older now, I realize that’s a lot to put on a kid.”  That pressure weighed on Cyrus, who felt like she struggled to balance being a young person and a professional all at once.  “It’s a lot to put on a kid to have them have to get their makeup done and then also balance school and then also have me dress up in a wig. It’s a little Toddlers and Tiaras,"" she says.

""I definitely look back on it as a good time,"" she muses. ""I think what was hard for me was balancing everything. I think it got harder when I started touring as both -- I toured as Hannah Montana and as myself.”  She also jokes that juggling the dueling Hannah/Miley personalities may have impacted her as an adult.  ""I think that’s probably what’s a little bit wrong with me now!” she laughs. “I mark that up to doing some extreme damage in my psyche as an adult person.”  WATCH: Miley Cyrus Shine in Her Duet With Dad Billy Ray on Beautiful Tom Petty Cover!  Still, Hannah is a character that Cyrus still embraces and appreciates for the message it offered her young fans.  ""I loved being that character,"" she admits. ""And honestly, music is everything and all people wanna have is great music and for that audience, for what that was, that was great music for kids to listen to. There’s a song called ‘Life’s What You Make it, so Let’s Make it Rock.’ Never forget that -- wise words. That’s a good thing to tell kids.""

65b0cc27-8eb2-4457-be1a-df6c4e47544e,"A Hollywood heartthrob and confirmed bachelor falls for a brilliant, humanitarian lawyer, and eventually, the two create the picture perfect family. It's the sort of love story you'd expect to see in a filmland fairytale, and yet somehow in just five short years it's become the real life romance of Amal and George Clooney.  Here's the story of how the dedicated duo met, fell in love, and built a life together.  Getty Images  They met through a friend—at George's home.  People say that true love finds its way to you, but the adage is rarely as literal as it turned out to be for George and Amal. The couple met at the actor's Lake Como home in July of 2013, when a mutual friend stopped by while en route to Cannes with Amal in tow. In an equally fateful twist, the star's parents were also visiting him at the time, so Amal was introduced to the Clooney family on the same day she met her now husband.  George, then 52, had cultivated a reputation as one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors with a dating history including celebs like Kelly Preston and Stacy Keibler, but there was clearly something special about his connection with the renowned human rights lawyer. “I got a call from my agent who said, 'I met this woman who is coming to your house, who you’re going to marry,'” George said during an appearance on My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman. “It really worked out that way.”  The two hit it off immediately, corresponding for several weeks before the romance truly blossomed. “She sent some pictures from when she was here, and we were writing each other, emailing, talking, mostly about what was going on in each other’s lives,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “And over a period of time it became clear we were more than just friends.”  Getty Images  Their first date was historic.  The duo's first official date came in October 2013 when George invited Amal, who was living in London, to come visit him at the famed Abbey Road Studios (best known as a recording home for The Beatles) while he supervised the score for his 2014 film The Monuments Men. ""That was a good first date,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter, adding: ""And pretty quickly, things escalated once I was in London.""  Getty Images  Amal was almost too shocked to say 'yes' when George proposed.  ""She'd had a conversation with her parents, who were like, 'What are George's intentions?' And she was saying, 'Take it easy. We've been going out for six months,'"" George explained. All the while he was preparing for the big moment.  After months of planning—down to a playlist of music to accompany the proposal—George invited Amal to a homecooked dinner on April 28, 2014, hiding the 7-carat engagement ring inside of a lighter box that Amal used to light the candlelit table. ""I did all the stuff, got down on my knee and did all the things you're supposed to do,"" the actor said. ""I was waiting for this song, 'Why Shouldn't I?' 'Why shouldn't I take a chance when romance passes by? / Why shouldn't I know of love?' It's a really good song about why can't I be in love? And it played, and she's like, 'Holy shit!' And she just kept staring at the ring, going, 'Oh, my God.' It was 20 minutes of me on my knee, waiting for her to say yes, because she was so shocked.""  Getty Images  They married in an intimate Venetian ceremony.  After a short engagement the couple tied the knot in September 2014, just shy of a year after their first date. ""We didn't tell anybody else that we were going to do it,"" Clooney recalled to The Hollywood Reporter, ""but eventually somebody figured it out. Oh, my God! Once people got wind of it, it became an event."" Surrounded by family (and a few famous friends, including Clooney's long-time collaborator Matt Damon, Cindy Crawford, and fellow celebrity couple John Krasinski and Emily Blunt) the couple wed in a private ceremony at the Aman Canal Grande luxury resort in Venice, Italy.  Getty Images  Children weren't part of their initial plan.  “It had never been part of my DNA,” George said, explaining his stance on fatherhood. “We didn’t plan on it. We never talked about it until after we were married, which is funny. There was an assumption that we didn’t want them. And then, after the wedding, we just felt we’d gotten very lucky, both of us, and we should share whatever good luck we’ve got. It would seem self-centered to just have that belong to us.”  When Amal became pregnant in 2016, the overjoyed couple got an additional surprise, in the form of twins. ""[The doctor performing the ultrasound] goes, 'Well, there's one.' And I said, 'Great.' And then he goes, 'And there's the second one.' And I was like, 'What?'"" Clooney told The Hollywood Reporter. ""We just sat there, staring at that piece of paper they give you, and I kept thinking there was a mistake."" But there was no mistake; in June of 2017, one month premature, Amal gave birth to twins Ella and Alexander.    Getty Images  They balance parenting with their demanding jobs.  Returning to her work representing refugees in September of 2017, Amal has managed to excel at the office and as a mom. ""She is sort of this remarkable human being and now mother which is something, I suppose, you should assume she would be wonderful at as well. But, when you see it in person, it makes you feel incredibly proud and also incredibly small,"" George told Letterman.  Coupled with George's creative work and the 2017 sale of his Casamigos tequila brand, the duo remain very busy, but make the time to dedicate to their children, traveling with them to some of the family's favorite spots around the globe.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1214
9d2e6644-dbe1-443f-ad2b-71a4becd09ad,"After more than a decade, actor Billy Bob Thornton shared what led to his divorce from actress Angelina Jolie in 2003.  Thornton has married six times, but his relationship with Jolie—who is 20 years younger than the Goliath actor—was among his most notable. Jolie was Thornton's fifth wife. The former spouses met on the set of Pushing Tin in 1999. At the time, he was engaged to Big Little Lies star Laura Dern. Thornton and Jolie tied the knot in 2000, but they separated three years later.  ""I remember our time together as really being great,"" Thornton, 62, said on The HFPA in Conversation podcast Wednesday. ""We just had different lifestyles. Hers is a global lifestyle, and mine is an agoraphobic lifestyle, so that's really—that's the only reason we're probably not still together maybe, because of a different path in life we wanted to take.""  Thornton said he's maintained a friendship with Jolie since their divorce. ""Angie is still a friend of mine, and she's a great person, and she's done so much,"" he told The HFPA. ""She makes movies that are important to her whether they succeed or fail, she still does what she believes in, and I'll always respect her for that.""  When Thornton and Jolie were together, they were known for their seemingly eccentric ways. They had an immediate attraction, which ultimately led Thornton to allegedly part ways with live-in fiancée Dern without warning.  Dern learned of Jolie and Thornton's relationship after receiving calls from tabloids.  ""I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I've never heard from him again,"" Dern said in Talk magazine 2000. ""It's like a sudden death. For no one has there been any closure or clarity.""  Jolie notably had Thornton's name tattooed along her arm, and they both wore a vial of each other's blood around their necks. The former pair announced their plans to adopt a child—Maddox Jolie-Pitt—from Cambodia together in March 2002, but it was later disclosed that Jolie adopted her eldest kid as a single parent.  Since parting ways, the Bad Santa actor married puppeteer Connie Angland in 2014. Jolie is in the midst of a custody battle with former spouse Brad Pitt.  Representatives for Jolie did not immediately return Newsweek's request for comment regarding Thornton's remarks.

He was 67. Cassidy died surrounded by his family, his publicist said. Cassidy's nephew tweeted that he didn't think ""I'm alone in saying that we will all miss him.""

""I was in denial, but a part of me always knew this was coming,"" he told People magazine about his diagnosis. His mother had suffered from the disease.  Cassidy was born in 1950 to singer and actor Jack Cassidy and actress Evelyn Ward. His big break came at age 20 when he nabbed the role of Keith Partridge, one of the singing kids of ""The Partridge Family,"" alongside his real-life stepmother Shirley Jones.  The show centered around a widow and her five children who traveled the country in a psychedelically-painted school bus. It ran from 1970-74, providing a feel-good, family show as the country struggled to find its footing after the tumultuous 1960s.  While ""The Partridge Family"" was never a huge hit in the ratings, the show excelled in tie-ins and producing hit songs. The theme song ""Come On, Get Happy"" became a hit, and the cast would later go on to make ten albums, all of which sold more than 1 million copies.

He had pop-star good looks and the 1970s trademark shaggy hair, helping fuel his teen idol status. He posed shirtless on the cover of Rolling Stone in 1972 with the headline ""Naked Lunch Box."" He tried to reject his ""bubble-gum"" image, talking about his drug use (""not smack, but grass and speed and psychedelics"").  Cassidy sold out Madison Square Garden in one day and toured internationally. But at London's White City Stadium, a 14-year-old girl was killed in a stampede when the 35,000 crowd surged forward when he appeared on stage. One ambulance man said the scene reminded him of the Blitz, according to The Independent.  By the end of 1974, ""The Partridge Family"" had ended and Cassidy quit touring, ending his days as a pop star. He eventually climbed back to the Top 40 with the 1990's ""Lyin' to Myself.""  Singer David Cassidy and wife Susan attend Rolling Stone Magazine's 1000th cover celebration on May 4, 2006, in New York.

He also took a turn at Broadway in a critically acclaimed role in ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" in 1982.  He appeared as one of the contestants on ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" although he was one of the first to be fired in 2011.  Later in life, Cassidy struggled with alcoholism and money troubles. He said he began drinking in 2002, and he was arrested several times for DUIs and sent through several rehab stints. He told CNN in 2014 that he was an alcoholic.

At the time, the comedian said he was willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt.  “It’s not like I wanted to give him a chance that night,” Chappelle clarified to Colbert “[But] I feel like a lot of white Americans finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans every cycle.”  Chappelle believes Americans will not only weather Trump’s presidency, he suggested that his policies will create better voters. “In the last six months I think we’re all getting an education about the presidency,” Chappelle added. “I don’t know that I’ve ever heard in the popular discourse people discussing ethics this much. And I didn’t even realize how ethics were necessarily supposed to work at that level of government, and he’s putting all this stuff on the forefront.  “I think [Trump]’s gonna make a more informed and better voter,” Chappelle said. “He’s a polarizing dude. He’s like a bad DJ at a good party.”  Last November, just days after Trump’s election win, Chappelle delivered a remarkable opening monologue on Saturday Night Live.

It made me feel hopeful and it made me feel proud to be an American and it made me very happy about the prospects of our country.”  “In that spirit,” he continued, “I’m wishing Donald Trump luck.

On Monday, Miller revealed that he’s leaving the Arrow-verse. “Currently shooting some of my final episodes as ‘Captain Cold/Leonard Snart’ on the CW’s Legends of Tomorrow and The Flash…” he said in a message posted on Instagram. “Grateful — now and in advance — to a pair of talented casts and hardworking crews…Thank you…”  He continued, “I’ve had a tremendous time playing this character… It’s been an opportunity, an education, and a f–king blast…”  Miller made his scene-stealing debut as the icy rogue on The Flash in season 1’s “Going Rogue.” This role would eventually reunite him with his Prison Break costar Dominic Purcell, who plays Mick Rory, a.k.a. Heat Wave. After recurring on The Flash, both men transitioned to DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. Even though Snart was killed off in the Legends’ season 1 finale, Miller became a series regular across all of the Arrow-verse shows and recurred on Legends and guest-starred on The Flash.  At San Diego Comic-Con in July, the Legends EPs revealed that Miller would return in season 3. “Mick Rory needs his pal, but unfortunately he’s not going to get the version of his pal that he remembers,” EP Phil Klemmer said during the show’s panel. EP Marc Guggenheim added, “We’re obviously really excited to bring Wentworth back on the show for a few episodes, but a different iteration of Mr. Snart. Chaos and merriment will ensue.”  Furthermore, the poster for this year’s four-way crossover “Crisis on Earth-X” confirmed that Miller would appear in that, too; Captain Cold’s face can be seen right above Barry’s right shoulder.

7eaa4f8a-dbce-45bc-b368-fc2497685b47,"Gabrielle Union is the newest victim of being in the wrong place at the wrong time — still, she's not taking any blame for somehow getting sucked into Hollywood's latest scandal.  Earlier this week, Tristan Thompson made headlines for all the wrong reasons when TMZ reported that the NBA star cheated on then-pregnant girlfriend Khloe Kardashian a handful of times ( Kardashian has since given birth ) — first, on April 7 during an outing in New York City, and before then, during an October 2017 encounter.  In one incriminating photo posted to The Shade Room 's Instagram account, Union mysteriously pops up behind one of Thompson's alleged flings. But the actress wasted no time immediately shutting down the idea that she had anything to do with any of it.  ""Don't know her. Didn't see her,"" Union wrote. ""I was enjoying my night with my mama and aunt. We ain't involved in this.""  Though it was reported that Kardashian was devastated upon hearing the news that Thompson may have been unfaithful, she has since been consumed by happiness upon the birth of her daughter , and People reports she is in the process of mending fences with her child's father.  “She’s basically already forgiven him,” a source said. “She is in a bubble of love and peace and happiness right now, and everything that happened with Tristan is less about ‘cheating’ and more like, it was just a random drunken hookup that meant nothing and was kissing at most and didn’t lead to anything else and was the fault of stupid groupies trying to trap him, and everybody just needs to move on.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,317
42f24f5e-73fa-4fde-b148-9948acfa4f26,"That's a wrap for ""Southern Charm New Orleans."" Sunday night's episode of the unscripted Bravo series marked the finale of its first season -- and, one has to believe, probably the finale of the series as a whole.  Of course, the Bravo suits could always surprise us and renew it for a sophomore season. But the fact of the matter is that the show had trouble building a steady audience from the beginning. In fact, after debuting April 25 to more than 1 million viewers, it didn't build at all, posting a viewership decline with nearly every episode, according to figures from ShowBuzz Daily.  Last week's penultimate episode marked the low-water mark, drawing fewer viewers -- 640,000 -- than any other episode so far this season. Nothing charming about that. (Viewership figures on Sunday's eighth and final episode were not available.)  By comparison, the ""Southern Charm"" mother ship, from which ""SoCharm NOLA"" was spun off, has yet to register fewer than 1 million voters in any of the nine episodes that have aired so far as part of its fifth season.  So, while there will certainly be some people who will mourn the end of ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" should Bravo decide to pass on a second season, I've got a feeling most people won't miss it -- because they apparently stopped watching pretty early on.  The reason behind the erosion of interest in the show is pretty simple to nail down: It was boring, built around limp writing and clumsily staged attempts at drama.  Granted, no reality show is actually ""real."" But if a producer wants his or her show to draw a reliable base of return viewers, they've got to help those viewers buy into the illusion. That was seldom the case with ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's an upside to it all, it's that the show was not the pox on local culture that many feared. In fact, its New Orleansness seemed to get more and more watered-down with nearly every episode, eventually reduced to little more than Chamber of Commerce images flashed between scenes, with an occasional bowl of gumbo thrown in. That's just as well, given that the show's efforts at including local culture in early episodes was ham-handed at best.  Even then, though, with so few people watching, it's hard to get too terribly worked up about it. As they say: No harm, no foul.  For those few who did watch regularly, producers were kind enough to wrap up most of the show's loose narrative threads in Sunday's finale. Below find a recap of the high points (and low points) of the Season 1 finale of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  The title: ""Better Late Than Pregnant.""  The centerpiece drama of the week: In what was perhaps the show's cheapest stunt yet -- and its most manufactured -- producers pulled a full-on okey-doke on viewers, in the form of a pregnancy scare for cast member Reagan Charleston.  That particular plot point was teased during the closing moments of the previous episode, but before getting to it in Episode 8, producers had hubby Jeff Charleston express his eagerness to become a father -- followed by Raegan informing him that she's not quite ready yet to be a mom. The next thing we know, her period is conveniently late.  So, she does what anybody would do: She takes a pregnancy test. At a huge season-ending party thrown by fellow cast member Jon Moody. And using a pregnancy test that was a gag gift at an adult Easter egg hunt from Episode 7.  And after all that? Spoiler alert: She ain't preggers.  That's right, ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" fans. You just got punk'd.  In all honestly, it's probably for the best, as on Monday (June 4) -- the day after the finale aired -- Reagan and Jeff announced they are separating.  The libation of the week: A French 75, ordered at breakfast by Tamica Lee.  The New Orleans cliche of the week: From a practical standpoint, the idea of throwing a party to end the season was a pretty good one, giving producers the opportunity to get everybody together one last time -- and decked out in their Sunday best -- to wrap up the season's myriad dramas.  That being said, it's nothing short of shameless that they framed it as a ""Jazz Fest launch party."" The show, and the episode has nothing to do with Jazz Fest. The cast never went to Jazz Fest. In fact, music has played a minor role in the series at best.  The honest question of the week: Speaking of the show's lack of focus on music, why didn't producers pick a local musician or two when they were casting the show? Not only would they have gotten some great music out of it, but the real behind-the-scenes dramas that play out on the local music scene have got to be better than the fake ones that played out on Season 1 of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's one thing that could get me interested in a second season, that would probably be it.  The real moment of the week: Of all the lose threads tied up in the season finale, easily the most touching was the reconciliation between cast member Tamica Lee and her daughter, third-grader Rani, with whom she butted heads in a previous episode -- and who has struggled with the fact that she's the only black kid at her school.  After sitting down for a heart-to-heart with the help of supporting cast member Susan Henry, Tamica and Rani hugged it out -- and cried it out -- in what was probably the sweetest moment of the season.  Granted, it all happened during a staged radio interview at local station WBOK, but this is one case where the end justifies the means. On a related note: If there's an MVP of the season, it's Rani, as far as I'm concerned.  The manufactured moment of the week: Raegan's pregnancy scare. (See ""The centerpiece drama,"" above.)  The quote of the week: ""We're just having some conversations."" -- Justin, to mother Dottie Reese, after she walked in on a heated conversation between Justin and girlfriend Kelsey.  I don't know why, but that line cracked me up. In fact, it's not just the quote of the week. It might be the quote of the whole season. I'm think I'm going to start using it whenever anybody butts into a conversation I'm having with somebody else.  Them: ""What are you guys talking about?""  Me: ""We're just having some conversations."" (Exits.)  The winner: The King Firm, where cast member Justin Reese's day job is. Every episode this season, they've bought airtime during the show for a commercial that prominently features Justin -- and which never fails to fool me into thinking the show is back on, thus prompting me to stop fast-forwarding through the commercials.  Granted, I start fast-forwarding again immediately upon realizing it's a commercial, but I know the firm's name now, whereas I didn't' before.  Nicely played, King Firm. Nicely played.  The loser: Me, for actually sitting through all eight episodes.  On the plus side, it's all been documented through the following stories, so future generations can remember the season that was.  As for me, I'm going to start trying to forget it, starting now.

""There's a lot of shame attached to mental illness. You feel like something it's wrong with you,"" Gaga says in the video, speaking from the kitchen of her Los Angeles home.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with William's brother Prince Harry lead the campaign and the Gaga video was the latest in their #oktosay series, which CNN reported shows ""people from all walks of life discussing their own mental health challenges."" Gaga says in the four-minute clip that she's a fan of the ""beautiful"" stories told in the series and was excited to share her own story about struggling with post traumatic stress disorder.  ""In my life I go, ‘Oh my goodness, look at all these beautiful wonderful things that I have, I should be so happy,’ but you can’t help it if you wake up in the morning and you are so tired and you are so sad and you are so full of anxiety that you can barely think,"" she says. Williams invited Gaga to participate after he read an open letter she issued through her Born This Way Foundation in which she revealed a sexual assault at 19 that left her with PTSD.  “It’s time that everyone speaks up and really feels very normal about mental health; it’s the same as physical health. Everybody has mental health and we shouldn’t be ashamed of it and just having a conversation with a friend or family member can really make such a difference,"" William says from a room at Kensington Palace. ""For me, the little bits that I’ve learnt so far is that it’s really important to have this conversation. You won’t be judged.""  The video's release came one day after Harry opened up about his years of therapy to deal with the loss of his mother, Princess Diana.

f62bb703-3443-4db0-82cb-f08f9e26b9fb,"A body found Thursday night is that of missing Frightened Rabbit frontman Scott Hutchison, police in Scotland confirmed Friday. The body was discovered about 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday (12:30 p.m. PT) in Port Edgar, Queensferry, just west of Edinburgh, the Scottish capital.  No official cause of death was given. A statement from Hutchison’s family, issued Friday afternoon by Police Scotland, said the singer had been struggling with mental health problems.  “As a family, we are utterly devastated with the tragic loss of our beloved Scott,” the statement said. “Despite his disappearance, and the recent concerns over his mental health, we had all remained positive and hopeful that he would walk back through the door, having taken some time away to compose himself. Scott, like many artists, wore his heart on his sleeve and that was evident in the lyrics of his music and the content of many of his social media posts.”  The family said Hutchison had “battled bravely with his own issues” for many years. “Depression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you,” the statement said. “We are immensely proud of [Scott] for being so open with his struggles. His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues.”  The 36-year-old singer and guitarist was reported missing early Wednesday, and was last seen near the Dakota Hotel in South Queensferry. Hutchison had issued a tweet Tuesday night referring to his life in the past tense: “Be so good to everyone you love….I didn’t live by that standard and it kills me.” Twenty minutes later, his final, poignant tweet simply said: “I’m away now. Thanks.”  Be so good to everyone you love. It’s not a given. I’m so annoyed that it’s not. I didn’t live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones. — Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018  I’m away now. Thanks. — Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018  Hutchison’s family was informed of the discovery of the body, and formal identification took place Friday.  Hutchison formed Scottish indie rock band Frightened Rabbit in 2003. The group’s first studio album, 2006’s “Sing the Greys,” featured just Hutchison and his brother Grant, who is the band’s drummer. Their most recent, fifth album, “Painting of a Panic Attack,” was released in 2016 on Atlantic Records.  The band also includes Billy Kennedy, Andy Monaghan and Simon Liddell. On Wednesday, the group tweeted: “We are worried about Scott, who has been missing for a little while now. He may be in a fragile state and may not be making the best decisions for himself right now.”  We are worried about Scott, who has been missing for a little while now. He may be in a fragile state and may not be making the best decisions for himself right now. Please could Scott or anyone with any information on his whereabouts please contact Police Scotland (101). — Frightened Rabbit (@FRabbits) May 9, 2018  News of the body’s discovery prompted tributes from other Scottish musicians, including Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos and Belle and Sebastian singer Stuart Murdoch.  Kapranos tweeted that Hutchison’s death was “a terrible loss.” Murdoch said the Scottish music community had been praying for a different outcome and encouraged anyone “having dark thoughts” to talk to family, friends or a doctor.  Irish rock band Snow Patrol said they were devastated to hear the news about their friend.  Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was “heartbreaking news,” calling Hutchison “a remarkable and much loved talent.”  Awful news about Scott Hutchison. A terrible loss. — alex kapranos (@alkapranos) May 11, 2018  Tragic news about Scott Hutchison. The whole music community in Scotland was praying for a different outcome.

The band was scheduled to begin another tour later this month.  The Hutchison brothers had announced a side project, with brothers Justin and James Lockey of alt-rock band group Minor Victories, called Mastersystem, which launched a debut album April 6. Scott Hutchison also released a solo album, “Owl John,” which was also his Twitter handle, in 2014.  POPULAR ON VARIETY:",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1045

Shortly after the pair attended the Voices in Displacement by the Syrian American Medical Society event in Los Angeles on Friday — where they held hands on the red carpet — the 39-year-old Keeping Up with the Kardashians star whisked her boyfriend away on a private plane for a special trip.

I just think that it’s really important for me to be there for them, and even though I want to go away and travel and do things for myself, it’s hard to find the balance of allowing myself to do that and not feel guilty.”  “I’ve definitely learned from my past relationship, where I really wouldn’t travel without the kids and I think it is important to take time — especially because my relationship is important to me and those worlds aren’t colliding right now — just making sure that I make time for both,” she continued. “I think going on a trip once in a while reminds me the importance of being present and in the moment when I’m at home, and I think it makes me the best mom that I can be.”  Kourtney Kardashian and Younes Bendjima Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty  A source previously told PEOPLE in December that things between Kardashian and Bendjima, who were first introduced during a trip to Paris in October 2016, are “definitely serious.”  “No one thought their relationship would last this long, but Kourtney is very happy,” remarked the insider. “Younes has met her kids. Kourtney’s family really likes him. He’s the opposite of Scott. He doesn’t party, isn’t flashy and really treats Kourtney with a lot of respect.

64cc18e9-cea1-4e3f-867e-ac5f4cee7bb2,"Harrison Ford was tight-lipped when asked about his reaction to late Star Wars costar Carrie Fisher’s revealing memoir during a recent interview, but the actor did manage to share one brief thought on the matter.  “It was strange. For me,” he said in GQ’s new cover story. In 2016, Fisher dropped a bombshell on fans of the franchise when she revealed in her memoir, The Princess Diarist, that she and Ford had an affair while on the set of the film that started the franchise,1977’s Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope.  At the time, Fisher was 19 and Ford was 33 – and married to his first wife, Mary Marquardt, with whom he had two children.  The steadfastly private actor admitted that he was given advance warning that Fisher planned to write about their affair (“to a degree”), but declined to go into detail about his reaction.  “Oh, I don’t know. I don’t know,” he said. “You know, with Carrie’s untimely passing, I don’t really feel that it’s a subject that I want to discuss.”  When asked whether he’s read Fisher’s nearly 300-page memoir, Ford responded shortly, “No. I didn’t.”  Ford remained silent throughout Fisher’s promotional tours and interviews for the book, though he was often asked for comment. In a chat with NPR’s Fresh Air host Terry Gross in late November of that year, Fisher expressed surprise that readers made such a big deal out of the three-month affair.  “I said, ‘I found the journals that I kept during the first movie, and I’m probably going to publish them,'” she said of the conversation she had with Harrison prior to moving forward with that chapter of the memoir. “And he just sort of raised his finger and said, ‘Lawyer!’ Then I said, ‘No, I won’t write anything that you don’t want. I mean, I’ll show it to you before and you can take anything out that you want taken out. I don’t want to make you uncomfortable’ – which I, of course, have. Unduly comfortable.”  “I wouldn’t have ambushed him like that, but it’s still – no matter if I told him or not, it probably feels like an ambush,” she continued. “It feels like an ambush to me, and I’m the one who wrote it.”  Fisher and Ford reunited on the big screen for 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and following Fisher’s death in December 2016, he issued a statement remembering her “fearless” spirit, though he made no mention of their romance.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,544

'He’s always been selfish and is clearly not thinking about how this will affect his children.'  It first emerged last month that David was no longer hiding his new love as he referred to himself as 'the lucky one' in the comments of Instagram photo Lesley shared of the two of them.  'David wasted no time and has already started dating again and has moved on entirely,' an insider told E! News at the time.  'It’s disgusting and cruel that David would be putting this out so publicly as their divorce is not yet finalized' a source told People  Falling apart: Shannon, 53, shared this inspirational quote to Instagram last week  'He’s been seeing this woman for at least a few weeks now and the word has spread around Newport Beach.'

The star is also asking for sole physical custody of their three children, 16-year-old Sophie and 13-year-old twins Stella and Adeline and joint legal custody.  Shannon has requested David be granted child visitation.  She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.

8c91d159-ccd9-4c5b-b9e9-0e59f555cb5d,"The Game of Thrones Season 7 finale was already the longest episode in the history of the series, but a cut scene could’ve made the 79-minute epic even longer — and it would’ve explained a mildly confusing plot twist.  Seeing Arya and Sansa fall for Littlefinger’s bullshit and go at one another’s throats for most of the season was frustrating for many viewers, but it was arguably worth it when the two Stark daughters teamed up and turned the tables on Petyr Baelish. Although the moment was undeniably awesome, it’s a little unclear when Sansa, Arya, and their brother/human computer Bran all got together to sort things out and end up on the same side. In an interview with Variety Isaac Hempstead Wright, who plays Bran, explained that they filmed that scene and it didn’t make the final episode.  “We actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks on Bran’s door and says, ‘I need your help,’ or something along those lines,” Hempstead Wright explained. “So basically, as far as I know, the story was that it suddenly occurred to Sansa that she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion and it might be a good idea to check with him first before she guts her own sister. So she goes to Bran, and Bran tells her everything she needs to know, and she’s like, ‘Oh, s—.’”  Hempstead Wright’s comments seem to confirm that Arya and Sansa weren’t secretly pretending to go along with Littlefinger’s ruse the whole time, as some suspected. Seeing Sansa and Bran actually work this out would’ve made for a nice scene that could’ve helped made the Winterfell plot feel a little more organic, but it also would have made their turn on Littlefinger less shocking.  It’s kind of Season 7 in a nutshell. The story moved fast enough that the showrunners had to leave out so much connective tissue and included some overly convenient plot points, which made the season as a whole feel less cohesive than earlier seasons. That style of storytelling, though, allowed for some great, great moments.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,424

If naming Shelton was a publicity stunt, it worked: Twitter users were so startled by the revelation that both “Blake Shelton” and “Sexiest Man Alive” trended for most of Wednesday, and the jokes flowed loudly and freely:  even a straight man can see there's no way blake shelton is the sexiest man alive. i dont think he's even the sexiest man named blake shelton. — Oliver Willis (@owillis) November 15, 2017  woke up this morning to news that blake shelton is the sexiest man alive. rip every sexy man in the world who died in the great sexy plague of 2017 overnight; u will be missed — I do not recall (@morninggloria) November 15, 2017  This is sexier than Blake Shelton https://t.co/j3B9B9cN4A — Jess Dweck (@TheDweck) November 15, 2017  Many social media users were quick to compare Shelton’s looks to things that are — how can we put this? — not sexy:  Blake Shelton looks like the dad in a drug commercial where they list off the side effects at the end while you watch him build a birdhouse. — DeShawn (@DeShawnstantine) November 15, 2017  Let's set the record straight: Blake Shelton looks like a second-stringer on Justified who gets murdered over a horse crime. — Kaleb Horton (@kalebhorton) November 15, 2017  If Blake Shelton is voted #SexiestManAlive then Ray Black Jr. is 2017's most popular driver. For real. Blake Shelton looks like a server at a Cracker Barrel in Gatlinburg. — nascarcasm (@nascarcasm) November 15, 2017  Blake Shelton looks like a guy who gets shredded by everyone on Shark Tank for the outrageous valuation he places on his pre-revenue floating “beer cup” that he invented after his wife left him, and it doesn’t get much sexier than that. — Gabe Delahaye (@gabedelahaye) November 15, 2017  blake Shelton looks like your middle school bus driver who got fired for buying four loko for the intimidating 8th graders who sit on the back of the bus https://t.co/fQCpg4Xx2g — maggie (@MaggieShmaggie) November 15, 2017  Of course, People is routinely derided for its choice of Sexiest Man Alive, which is a transparently PR-driven exercise often jokingly equated to a “best publicist” award. As such, each year’s choice invites a wave of alternate opinions, and 2017 is no exception, with social media users being quick to point out other, sexier alternatives to Shelton:  The same people who voted in People’s sexiest alive man list are the same folks who tampered w/ the presidential elections    There’s no way Blake Shelton is the sexiest man w/ Trevante Rhodes still breathing. pic.twitter.com/cd5NTcKJp4 — Corey Townsend (@JarrieBradshaw) November 15, 2017  Twitter users had many opinions on who the actual sexiest men of the year were, but a general consensus seemed to form around the triad of perennially overlooked frontrunner Idris Elba, upcoming Aquaman actor Jason Momoa, and the usual gaggle of white guys named Chris:  Forget the fact that Idris Elba should’ve obviously won. I can even think of like 5 white guys named Chris who are more deserving of the Sexiest Man Alive title than Blake Shelton. — Brohibition Now (@OhNoSheTwitnt) November 15, 2017  Blake Shelton is People’s Sexiest Man Alive because apparently Idris Elba, Chris Evans and Jason Momoa fell off the planet last night. — Jenn C (@TheJennC) November 15, 2017  But despite the jokes, there’s plenty of reason beyond the subjective nature of sexiness to be critical of People’s decision — namely because Shelton has been flagrantly and repeatedly homophobic in the past, once “joking” in a 2011 tweet that he would leave any gay man who tried to touch him beaten and bloody.  He also used the stage at the Country Music Awards for an awkward gay joke about Jake Gyllenhaal because he starred in Brokeback Mountain, and has repeatedly referenced gay panic and jokes about finding lesbians hot on his Twitter account. In the past, he’s made toxic jokes about women, including noting, in 2010, a “sick fantasy” about then-16-year-old Dakota Fanning, and has repeatedly made Islamophobic and xenophobic jokes about non-English-language speakers and foreigners around him.  Last year, after the tweets were uncovered and public outcry arose, he attempted to pass off all of his statements as comedy. Yet since then he’s gone on to openly decry “political correctness,” and last year praised Donald Trump for “say[ing] what he thinks,” without acknowledging the coded racism and bigotry that often underlies Trump’s statements.  After the news about Shelton’s new title began circulating, many began pointing out the singer’s problematic history:  I guess it makes sense in Trump's America that an Islamophobe who ""jokes"" about beating up gay men would be named the ""Sexiest Man Alive."" — Melissa McEwan (@Shakestweetz) November 15, 2017  For anyone who wants to shame people for making fun of the fact that Blake Shelton is “Sexiest Man Alive” (barf) remember that he’s a giant homophobe who once wrote a parody to “Any Man Of Mine” by Shania Twain that describes him assaulting men who show interest in him. FYI. — Sexiest Man Alive, Dan Blackroyd (@danblackroyd) November 15, 2017  Just in case you guys didn't know, not only did Blake Shelton tweet racist & homophobic things he also made jokes about having ""sick fantasies"" about Dakota Fanning when she was 16 — Tatum Robinson (@TatumAlexis10) November 15, 2017  Still, some were quick to point out that it’s not the first time People has made odd decisions in its annual Sexiest Man vote. For starters, the list has historically been overwhelmingly white, with only two men of color ever gracing its cover — Denzel Washington in 1996 and The Rock in 2016. This fact, combined with backlash over Shelton, had many onlookers pointing out how problematic the list has historically been.  just a reminder that only two men of color have been picked as the sexiest man alive in 32 years, people magazine is trash https://t.co/TVDNNcCMch — adam (@brokeangeI) November 15, 2017  Not to mention how weird some of the choices have been:  Clearly, People’s Sexiest Man award is yet another public institution that needs to be dismantled and rebuilt from its sexy foundations.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1295
c9321bc4-c839-4f9b-9ced-456d83925e5c,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Corey Feldman‘s long-awaited documentary on child sexual abuse in Hollywood has a harrowing title.  The “Lost Boys” star named his film “Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys,” focusing on his sexual assault and the alleged rape of his late longtime friend and fellow child star, Corey Haim.  “I believe this title represents the truth I have been promising to tell and it also represents the truth of what happened,” Feldman, 47, told Us Weekly on Tuesday. “[Haim] was physically raped, I was physically assaulted and as a result of those actions, and the fact that I had to carry that burden all those years, really it was a raping of not only our emotional lives, but also our collective work and career as The Two Coreys.”  Last year, Feldman launched an IndieGogo campaign seeking $10 million to “create an affront” against child sexual abuse and expose an alleged pedophilia ring with his movie.  “I propose to do this by making a film that will be [the most] honest and true depiction of child abuse ever portrayed, by telling my own story in a very real way, in a very honest way, with no editing, no censorship, no studio behind it,” he said in a video about the “Truth project.” “I will make the film, I will direct the film, I will produce the film, and I will self-distribute it to guarantee it gets a theatrical release with your donations. Additionally, it will help me buy the security and the legal team I need to protect my family until the project is released.”  Feldman’s allegations of pedophilia in Hollywood have resurfaced in light of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and director James Toback.  The “Stand By Me” actor’s 2013 appearance on “The View,” in which Barbara Walters chided him for speaking out against “an entire industry,” went viral last year.  The news of Haim’s portrayal in Feldman’s film may not sit well with the late actor’s mother.  Judy Haim previously slammed Feldman for speaking of Corey Haim’s alleged sexual assault and abuse, even sending him a cease and desist in 2016, after which Feldman promised he’d stop talking about Corey Haim in the press.  She was particularly incensed at reports that a then-19-year-old Charlie Sheen allegedly raped Corey Haim when Haim was 13 on the set of “Lucas,” an accusation Sheen himself has denied — and sued over.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,498

The RHOC stars have been at odds since Edmonds, 32, asked Dodd, 41, if it was true that she was cheating on Michael with her boyfriend — and Dodd responded by telling Edmonds that her husband Jim was having an affair while she was pregnant.  Dodd carried their feud over to her Bravo blog, where she commented on her costars’ marriages — and took a stab at the Edmonds’ relationship!  “How great are our guys?” she wrote before talking about Diko and Peggy Sulahian and Doug and Lydia McLaughlin.  “Michael too supports my decision to get a breast reduction, even though he thinks my boobs are ‘perfect,’” she continued. “He respects that it is my body and whatever makes me happy is his priority. Michael has always been there with me at every medical procedure. For example, when we were going through IVF, he attended every doctor visit, administered all of my shots, he was present when the embryos were implanted, as well as attending all my prenatal care appointments. Not all of our husbands are so supportive, right Meghan?”  Radar previously reported that Edmonds was forced to undergo her IVF treatments alone, as her husband was on the road for his baseball hosting gig. She later confessed that he was a distant dad who was “removed” from her pregnancy and insiders told Radar he was “pulling away” as well.  The former baseball pro even missed their daughter Aspen’s conception and his wife’s baby shower.  Edmonds also claimed via Twitter that Dodd made hurtful claims about her postpartum depression, but the comments have since been removed.

She finally confessed backstage at the Emmys that season 2 is coming “this year, they’re waiting for us to finish the show, it’s coming out this year.”  When Mrs. Maisel dropped last November it was in the heat of the #MeToo movement. The media was quick to observe how the show about a newly-separated single woman who is vying to become a stand-up in a male-dominated late 1950s world, just rang so loudly with the times.  “You never set out to drive a political message through your show, it just won’t work,” said Sherman-Palladino, “You gotta love the show, love your characters, it was an interesting fluke that Maisel came out when we were taking trolls down. I’m glad it’s a character that still resonates. We can look back at 1959 and see that today women aren’t wearing corsets anymore, but the problems still exist.”  The entire late 50s comedy era “is Oz” for Sherman-Palladino having grown up in the San Fernando Valley, listening to her father’s story about Greenwich Village, and opening up for Johnny Mathis and Dinah Washington.  Season 2 is “about opening Midge’s world up,” says Palladino.

59c392ca-bbe1-4b10-a6e5-2c08f034f6f7,"Artist, DJ, and producer Tim Bergling, a.k.a. Avicii, died Friday afternoon in Oman, according to a statement from his rep. He was 28.  “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,” the statement reads. “He was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.”  One of the most popular and successful electronic dance-music artists of all time — he scored a No. 4 hit on the Billboard 200 in 2013 with “Wake Me Up” and regularly appeared in the Top 5 of Forbes’ “Highest-Paid DJs” lists — he retired from live performing in 2016 at the peak of his success, citing health reasons. He had suffered from health problems for several years, including acute pancreatitis, in part due to excessive drinking. He had his gallbladder and appendix removed in 2014.  He posted the following statement on his website last year:  “WE ALL REACH A POINT IN OUR LIVES AND CAREERS WHERE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT MATTERS THE MOST TO US.  For me it’s creating music. That is what I live for, what I feel I was born to do.  Related Celebrities Who Died in 2018  Last year I quit performing live, and many of you thought that was it. But the end of live never meant the end of Avicii or my music. Instead, I went back to the place where it all made sense – the studio.  The next stage will be all about my love of making music to you guys. It is the beginning of something new.  Hope you’ll enjoy it as much as I do.”  Bergling was born in Stockholm on Sept. 8, 1989. He began DJing as a teenager and released his first single in 2007. He released a large number of singles and remixes in the following years and rapidly built a reputation as a live act. He broke through with his 2010 hit “Seek Bromance,” which charted in several European countries; he signed a publishing deal with EMI the same year. He explained his chosen DJ name as “the lowest level of Buddhist hell,” chosen because his real name was already being used by another Tim Bergling on MySpace.  His 2011 single “Levels,” which was later nominated for a Grammy Award, vaulted him into the mainstream, charting in multiple European countries and topping the chart in his native Sweden. “Sunshine,” his 2012 collaboration with David Guetta, was nominated for a Grammy for best dance recording. In September of that year, he became the first DJ to headline New York’s prestigious Radio City Music Hall; at those two shows, he previewed a new song with Mike Posner titled “Stay with You.”  His proper debut album, “True,” was released on September 2013, much of which was previewed during his headlining set at the Ultra Music Festival earlier that year. The album featured “Wake Me Up,” a collaboration with Aloe Blacc, which topped the charts in multiple countries across the world and was No. 1 for a record 14 weeks on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Songs chart; it was also the U.K.’s fastest-selling single of 2013. Other singers on the album included Adam Lambert and Audra Mae. He also worked with Madonna during this period and contributed to two songs on her 2015 album “Rebel Heart,” although both parties seemed unhappy with the collaboration and Avicii said the final versions were quite different from his demos.  The extent of his popularity was reflected in a 2014 “Saturday Night Live” digital short called “When Will the Bass Drop?,” with comic Andy Samberg playing a fictional mega-DJ named “Davvincii” (although he was made up to look more like David Guetta).  However, as his popularity rose, his health declined. He was hospitalized in March 2014 and cancelled several tour appearances; not long after, he collaborated with Carlos Santana and Wyclef on the official FIFA World Cut Anthem “We Will Find a Way.” Also that year, he produced a song on Coldplay’s album “Ghost Stories.” He released his second full-length album, “Stories,” in October 2015.  In March of 2016, he performed at the Ultra Music Festival, premiering new material, but 10 days later announced that he was retiring from performing. He made a final live appearance in August in Ibiza. In December, he parted ways with longtime manager Ash Pournouri.  In August of 2017 he released a six-track EP entitled “Avici,” which he said was the first of three installments that would be his next album. He followed a month later with a full-length documentary called “True Stories,” which was largely about his retirement. In it, promoters are seen trying to convince him to continue touring, even though he’s in obvious physical pain. “I looked at myself like, ‘F—, you should’ve really stood up for yourself more there. Come on, Tim!,'” he said of the documentary to Rolling Stone in an interview published last September. “Why didn’t I stop the ship earlier?”  “I needed to figure out my life,” he continued. “The whole thing was about success for the sake of success. I wasn’t getting any happiness anymore. Now that I have more time in the studio, I want to learn as much about other genres as possible. That’s what I love the most – having a session with Nile Rodgers, for instance, and getting an understanding of music that’s invaluable.”  RELATED CONTENT  Musicians, Celebrities Pay Tribute to Avicii  Avicii’s Biggest Hits (Listen)  ‘Avicii: True Stories’ Documentary Reveals Star DJ’s Struggles With Health, Fame and Early Retirement  Avicii’s Life and Career in Photos  POPULAR ON VARIETY",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1150

f86a533c-fa67-42a8-aa45-7535959ed06a,"Which celebrities are most likely to have had nose jobs? The subject is a hotly debated one. Some celebs come clean and admit that they've had work done, including a ""nose job"" (rhinoplasty). Others definitely look like they've had some sort of plastic surgery, but they won't say one way or the other. This list includes many celebrities who are suspect, including celebrities with big noses who all of a sudden look different one day. Everyone listed here is rumored to have had a nose job, or has openly admitted to having one. Some are obvious, while others are far more subtle. Vote for the celebs you think have gone under the knife to alter their appearance by getting a nose job – and add anyone that might be missing, too!  Celebrities who are rumored to have had nose jobs include Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Zac Efron, Natalie Portman, Patrick Dempsey, Megyn Kelly, Tom Cruise, Ellen Barkin, and Blake Lively. Nose job surgery isn't a huge deal, but these celebs like to keep their privacy. With some celebrities, spotting a nose job is rather obvious: Jennifer Aniston, anyone? And of course, no list of celebs and/or nose jobs would be complete without the Queen of Plastic Surgery, Joan Rivers. She openly admits having multiple procedures over several decades.  Things don't always turn out well, especially when multiple plastic surgeries (and nose jobs) are involved (La Toya Jackson, La Toya Jackson, La Toya Jackson). Anytime anyone goes under the knife for any reason, it's a risk – to both health, and career. Jennifer Grey has said that getting a nose job ruined her career (no one recognized her)!  Celebrities who may (or may not) have had nose jobs also include supermodels. Gisele Bundchen and Kate Moss are both suspect, for example. There's no hard proof, but looking at older photos, it's hard not to wonder. Maybe the celeb just grew into their nose –or maybe not. If they're suspect, they're on the list. Period.  Not everyone, though, is so forthcoming about whether they have or haven't had a nose job. That's why this list exists! Sometimes it's hard to be sure, but you suspect it. And if you suspect it? Vote here for the celebrities you think are most likely to have had nose jobs.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,468

The country star and his wife, Brittany, announced the news via Instagram on July 10 with a photo of his 7-month-old son.  In the picture, Memphis is lounging in a onesie that reads: Big Brother.  Aldean has two older daughters, Keeley and Kendyl, from his first marriage, and he made no secret of the fact that he and Brittany planned to have another child as soon as possible after he and Brittany welcomed Memphis on Dec. 1, 2017.  ""Our theory is, 'Hey, we got one in diapers and formula right now so, while we're in this mindset we might as well knock it out,'"" Aldean told Taste of Country Nights in April . ""We both agreed that we wanted to have two. I have two older daughters and there's a pretty big age difference in my two older daughters and Memphis, so we wanted to have one who's a little closer in age to him so he has somebody to hang out with.""

3ae5869e-09c4-4ab4-aca1-97e9d30c38b6,"President Trump has zero impulse control. That’s why he flip-flops on issues, sends a constant stream of ill-conceived tweets, can’t keep his hands off women, and never misses an opportunity to shoot himself in the foot. Recently, former George W. Bush adviser Steve Schmidt called Trump out for his childish behavior. “Clearly, we have a 71-year-old president of the United States who has the impulse control of a little child, who feels aggrieved, who’s resentful, who’s a constant victim,” he told MSNBC.  As someone who has lived on the surface of the Earth for over 70 years, Trump should know that one of the worst things you can do is stare directly at the sun. One prolonged gaze into our solar system’s center of energy can cause permanent eye damage. “The light from the sun is very intense and concentrated into a very small area, and then that light is converted into heat and that heat cooks the retina,” said Joel Schuman, chair of ophthalmology at New York University’s Langone Health. “So you have a permanent area that you don’t see, a permanent blind spot.”  On Monday, when Trump stood in front of reporters on the Truman Balcony at the White House with his wife, Melania, and his son, Barron, he had one job: resist the temptation to stare directly at the sun. Even after a White House aid yelled, “Don’t look at it!” our ever-defiant leader with self-described “very good brain” craned his neck, squinted his eyes, and stared directly into the sun.  Later Monday night, he’ll address the country on the ongoing war in Afghanistan.  Someone shouts ""don't look"" as Pres.

She started out on The Real Housewives of Atlanta and even has her own show now called Don’t Be Tardy. Kim is returning to this season of RHOA and now she is speaking out about the one thing that is bad about having your entire life filmed. E! Online shared what Kim had to say about it all. A new season of Don’t Be Tardy will start airing on Friday. This show lets everyone get a glimpse into her everyday life.  E! News had to ask Kim what was hard about having the cameras around all the time. Kim did share that Bravo is really respectful about everything with her family especially when her son Kash ended up being attacked by a dog. Kim said she couldn’t do a show like this for a network that didn’t respect her and it sounds like they are great about working with her.  Another thing that Kim Zolciak-Biermann shared is that she just lives her life and the cameras are there. Most of their life gets filmed and as fans have seen ends up airing on the show. Kim is fine with that most of the time. Viewers have seen her fight with the kids and more on their show.  So what does Kim Zolciak-Biermann think is a downside to having the cameras around all the time? She said, “That’s the only real down side is where there is something like super major going on that’s kind of difficult.” Kim was talking about the time when her son Kash was attacked by a dog. The cameramen were there and filming. Kash was hurt pretty bad and had to have surgery.  It does look like Kim Zolciak-Biermann is going to let the fans see some of what went down with Kash when he was attacked. So far, Kim hasn’t revealed a lot like who the dog belonged to or how it went down. More than likely, she is saving all of that for the show.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BY8RRxzh62r/?hl=en&taken-by=kimzolciakbiermann  Are you excited for a new season of Don’t Be Tardy?

1e1918b4-ca05-4b47-9318-81db6c6ae612,"EXCLUSIVE: Johnny Depp and his former business managers will not be kicking off a potential messy and revealing trial over the Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald star’s long-held fraud claims of $25 million next month after all.  After a long weekend in which attorneys for both Depp and the Management Group went hard, the parries reached a confidential settlement, I hear. While no one is talking, both sides in what has been a sometimes bitter and revelatory legal knife fight are happy with the deal, Deadline has learned.  Prodded by a Los Angeles judge and overseen by a retired one, the managed mediation between Depp’s lawyer and TMG’s reps from Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert LLP comes after the actor’s primary attorney Ben Chew of Washington D.C.’s Brown Rudick failed late last month to get the August 15 starting trial pushed back. It’s rare for a plaintiff to seek a delay in a trial that they requested, and the unusual hearing came on the heels of a long Rolling Stone profile of the Depp that pretty much everyone agrees was not a winner for the actor. Another factor in the agreement hammered out over talks on Saturday and Sunday was Depp finally sitting down for a frequently postponed deposition in the matter back in May in L.A.  Now, with the deal sealed, all that’s old news and all that is left is the formalities.  Which means, if things go as they usually do in these things, that in the next couple of weeks, dismissal filings are likely to pop up in L.A. Superior Court dropping Depp’s initial action of January 2017 and the commission-seeking cross-complaint that soon followed. The November 2017 action for judicial foreclosure against several of the actor’s City of Angels properties by TMG over a $5 million loan that they said that made to him will also be closed.  Following the submission of that paperwork, the settlement agreement is expected to be approved before the August 15 trial start date, which is basically a moot note on the calendar at this point. A fact that will make Warner Bros very happy as sources say that the studio was not looking forward to a public hearing of The Crimes of Grindelwald’s marketing campaign and opening this fall of the latest installment in this J.K. Rowling’s franchise being flooded by headlines of Depp’s allegedly excessive spending habits and dwindling financial resources.  While the bloodletting between the actor and TMG is over now, the settlement in that matter does not, however, end the other litigation tidal waves that the Pirates of the Caribbean star is wading through. Depp still has to contend with a lawsuit from his ex-bodyguards who claim drug abuse and owed pay as well as a countersuit from his former longtime attorneyJacob Bloom and his.

d07dccef-92a5-4ee0-8d67-9e0675f184fd,"[Warning: This story contains major spoilers from episode 808, ""How It's Gotta Be,"" of AMC's The Walking Dead, as well as the comic book series on which the show is based.]  Given the magnitude of the twist, it's no surprise that many Walking Dead fans are upset about the looming departure of Carl Grimes, the young survivor played since season one by Chandler Riggs — and that list includes Riggs' own father, who took to social media to express his disappointment in Walking Dead showrunner Scott M. Gimple over how his son's exit was handled.  ""Watching Gimple fire my son 2 weeks before his 18th birthday after telling him they wanted him for the next 3 years was disappointing,"" Riggs' father wrote on Facebook following the AMC zombie drama's midseason finale, in which Carl was revealed to be suffering from a fatal zombie bite. ""I never trusted Gimple or AMC, but Chandler did. I know how much it hurt him. But we do absolutely know how lucky we have been to be a part of it all and appreciate all the love from fans all these years!""  Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, Riggs stated the decision to leave The Walking Dead was not his own, despite speculation that he was eyeing an exit in order to focus on college.  ""I'm taking a gap year right now to focus on acting for a while. Leaving Walking Dead wasn't my decision,"" Riggs told THR. ""I was planning on going to college until I found out. I found out when I was doing rehearsals for episode six back in June. It was quite the shocker for me, Andy and everyone because I don't think anyone saw it coming. It's definitely not a bad thing because it has been awesome being on the show but now I get to go and do a lot of other stuff that I haven't gotten to do before. Scott wanted to meet in person because it was such a big deal. We had just finished rehearsing for a scene in episode six and he wanted to meet with me and my mom and dad and talk about what's going to happen.""  ""That is a bite on his side. … It will play out as bites play out on the show,"" Gimple said Sunday on AMC's post-show Talking Dead, speaking about the character's exit. ""It's very important to Carl's story and the entire story, what happens in the next episode. I'm just focused on the fact that Carl right now is alive and he has some business to attend to. That is a one-way ticket. But I'd like to think that the things we see in the next episode are so important to his life and the other characters' lives.""  Riggs' impending exit from The Walking Dead is a shock for a number of reasons, including the fact that he is one of only five castmembers from the original season who still appear on the show. One of the others, Lennie James (Morgan), will depart The Walking Dead this season as well, joining the cast of Fear the Walking Dead for its fourth season.  What's more, Carl remains an active presence in the Walking Dead comic books from Robert Kirkman and Charlie Adlard, on which the show is based. Many fans believed Carl would one day assume the lead role in the series, including Andrew Lincoln, who plays Rick Grimes, and has subsequently described Carl's demise as ""the biggest death"" of the entire series.  ""My first reaction was silence,"" Lincoln told THR about his first reaction to learning of Carl's death. ""Scott Gimple called me up and said, 'You're going to hate this one.' He's very good about alerting the cast when there's going to be a [character] death. I tried guessing four times and was nowhere near Chandler Riggs' name. Scott had to say that it was Carl. I just didn't speak for a minute. I always thought Carl was going to be the one who led the show forward; that Rick would hand over his boots and revolver when he walked off into the sunset in season 28.""  In the comics, Carl plays a central role in one of the story's most recent arcs, ""The Whisperer War,"" as his relationship with an outsider named Lydia causes a conflict between the Alexandrians and a group of survivors called the Whisperers, who walk among the walkers using flesh suits as camouflage.  ""I was excited to do a lot of those storylines in the comics because there's a lot of really cool stuff,"" Riggs told THR. ""I'm more excited to do other things than The Walking Dead than I was excited about doing those things on Walking Dead.""  AMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.

Created by Julie Plec, “The Originals” is a spinoff of “The Vampire Diaries,” which premiered in 2013. The flagship “Vampire” series signed off this spring, ending its eight season run, so renewing “Originals” keeps the franchise at the network for at least another season.  “Originals” follows Joseph Morgan’s Klaus Mikaelson and his family in New Orleans. Morgan stars alongside Daniel Gillies, Phoebe Tonkin, Charles Michael Davis, Yusuf Gatewood and Riley Voelkel. Plec serves as executive producer with Leslie Morgenstein. The series hails from Bonanza Productions Inc., My So-Called Company, Alloy Entertainment, Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios.  The show has remained relatively stable in its fourth season, which is currently averaging a 0.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 972,000 viewers per episode. That represents a decrease of just 11% in the key demo and a slight increase in total viewers compared to Season 3.  Related ‘No Tomorrow,’ ‘Frequency’ Canceled After 1 Season at the CW  “iZombie” is based on the characters from DC Entertainment’s Vertigo imprint. Rose McIver toplines the series, and stars alongside Malcolm Goodwin, Rahul Kohli, Robert Buckley, David Anders and Aly Michalka. The show hails from “Veronica Mars” creator Rob Thomas, who executive produces with Diane Ruggiero-Wright, Danielle Stokdyk and Dan Etheridge. Bonanza Productions Inc., Spondoolie Productions and Warner Bros. Television produce the series.  Now in its third season, this supernatural procedural has dipped quite a bit in ratings. Midway through Season 3, it is averaging a 0.3 rating and 905,000 viewers per episode, down over 30% in both measures from Season 2.  With both renewals, the CW has officially made decisions for every returning show for the 2017-2018 season. “Originals” and “iZombie” join already-renewed series “Arrow,” “D.C.’s Legends of Tomorrow,” “The Flash,” “Supergirl,” “Jane the Virgin,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” and “Supernatural.” The network cancelled freshman series “No Tomorrow” and “Frequency.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,442

Splash News  Earlier this week, Bella Thorne took to Snapchat to show off a large bouquet of flowers that she received. A few hours later, Kourtney Kardashian took to Snapchat to show off a huge bouquet of flowers that she received.  Both sets of flowers looking quite similar in size, type and color.  According to multiple reports, the flowers were sent to both women by Scott -- perhaps as a bit of mea culpa for his recent behavior.  TMZ (who has images of the flowers) reported on June 15 that Bella's flowers were indeed sent from Scott. Bella shared the image in which her hair matched the color of the roses. ""Now I match z flowers,"" she said.  Scott, if you'll recall, took Bella to the Cannes Film Festival and proceeded to flirt with a parade of women. The actress went home early and reports said she felt ""used"" by Scott.  Splash News  On May 25 she tweeted, ""Yo this #cannes fancy life isn't for me"" to her 6.6 million followers.

When another fan inquired what she was doing with the ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" star Bella responded, ""Legit nothing trolololo""  Kourtney, meanwhile, is said to be less than thrilled with the father of her three children and reportedly won't allow him to see their children unless he sobers up.

Buzz60  After Bachelor Nation witnessed her emotional departure, Bekah Martinez (aka Bekah M.) appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Monday night. And while she did talk about her disappearance from Arie Luyendyk Jr.'s season of ABC's dating show, it was her appearance on a Humboldt County, Calif. missing persons list that was largely on Kimmel's mind.  Humboldt County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Samantha Karges told The North Coast Journal Martinez was reported missing on Nov. 18 by her mother who had not heard from her since Nov. 12. Karges said, ""Martinez had reportedly come to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm.""  Offering an explanation as to why she made the missing person's list, Martinez said, ""A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying that I was on a farm when I was actually on The Bachelor, but no. I had already been eliminated from the show, and I just decided to go up to the mountains with some friends for a couple of weeks.""  ""I was there for six or seven days without phone service, which I thought I was going to have phone service and I told my mother that I would,"" she continued.  Martinez told the late night host that after about a week she felt a strong inclination to return home.  ""I just had this weird feeling on like the sixth or seventh day, I was like, 'I need to go home now,'"" she said. ""So, I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents and then come to find out only 12 hours before my mother had called the Humboldt (County) Sheriff’s (Office) saying that I was missing.""  So what was Martinez doing on a marijuana farm exactly? Trying to spice up her Bachelor lower third in case she appears on the franchise again? Not quite, she explained.  ""To set the record straight, I’m not a weed farmer,"" she said. ""I am still a nanny in L.A., but, yes, my friends have a weed farm up in Humboldt County.""  As for how she's doing after getting eliminated, Martinez said, ""I'm hanging in there. It was shocking for me as well, but I'm picking up the pieces as I go along.""

Khloe Kardashian, 34, has been continuing to try and make her relationship with baby daddy Tristan Thompson, 27, work after his shocking cheating scandal went public back in Apr. but some of her close family and friends believe it may not be a good thing. “Plenty of people in Khloe‘s life are questioning her decision to keep trying so much and giving so much to Tristan but it’s not their choice to make,” a Kardashian insider EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. “Khloe is following her heart and doing what she feels is best for her and her daughter. She doesn’t want to give up and Tristan has made it clear he wants a future with her and six-month-old True. People have accused her of being in denial about their future but Khloe insists she’s not in denial, she’s just choosing to move past the negativity and find happiness.”  Khloe’s ability to forgive and try to make things better between her and her basketball player beau is impressive considering how difficult things were for her in the days right before giving birth. The cheating scandal and Khloe’s labor were spotlighted in the latest episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians and the new mom took to her social media account before it aired to reveal that it was tough for her to watch the intense scenes.  “Tonight’s episode is an uncomfortable and super emotional one for me, but when we signed up for this show over a decade ago, we signed up for a reality show, which meant showing you guys inside our lives, the good, the bad and the ugly,” Khloe wrote in a caption on Instagram. “To relive these moments all over again is incredibly difficult emotionally but I also hope that with every trail [SIC], tribulation and curve ball life throws at us, that we ALL get to learn from our journeys.”  Although Khloe has been working hard on the relationship, she admitted that her initial reaction to Tristan’s alleged cheating was a lot more intense than was seen on camera. She was in Cleveland, OH at the time, where Tristan’s basketball team, the Cleveland Cavaliers are based, and there were no cameras there to witness her response but she did give a hint as to how it was to her followers on Twitter. “Oh well thank God a camera was NOT with me in Cleveland!!!

After two seasons and 20 episodes, the E! network on Tuesday announced they will not renew The Arrangement, one of its two scripted series, for a third season.  The fictional celebrity drama, which certainly never mined the Church of Scientology and the marriage of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes for source material, aired what turned out to be its series finale on May 13. That episode, titled ""Suite Revenge,"" was--at least for a short time--regarded as the Season 2 finale. It was seen by 432,000 viewers and drew a 1.8 rating in the 18-49 demo.  ""Over two seasons, E!'s scripted series The Arrangement has taken viewers inside the world of an A-list movie star filled with secrets, scandal and romance,"" wrote an E! spokesperson in a statement to Deadline on Tuesday. ""While we have decided not to move forward with the series, we are incredibly grateful to the cast and our production partners.""  The Arrangement was produced by Universal Cable Productions and starred Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista, Lexa Doig and Michael Vartan.  The series stylized itself as a high-stakes Hollywood love story exploring the bizarre and sinister underbelly of incredible fame. Ratings for its first season in the spring of 2017 were fruitful by cable standards, having drawn an average of 1.3 million viewers overall and 725,000 in the 18-49 demo. Most commendably, the show became the year's second-most watched new scripted cable drama with women ages 18-34.  Despite its strong start, ratings for Season 2 declined by double digits and the show reached its low point in the middle of this year's 10-episode spring run with a stretch of episodes viewed by 400,000 people or less.  ""Sad to say I got the call that #TheArrangement won't be coming back for a 3rd season,"" tweeted creator, executive producer and writer Jonathan Abrahams early Tuesday night. ""There's grieving to be sure but also gratitude for the opportunity and the experience of working with so many wonderful and talented people. Thanks for all your support, twitter peeps. Much [love].""  As of now, The Royals stands alone as E!'s only remaining scripted series; sticking out like a bearskin hat in a mob of reality programming (Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Total Bellas, Botched) and celebrity docuseries like Citizen Rose, Very Cavallari and Model Squad.  For its part, The Royals also suffered a marked downturn in ratings this year. Its fate is additionally in limbo following the December 2017 ouster of creator-showrunner Mark Schwahn over sexual harassment allegations.  While a twin-killing of scripted fare could be in the offing at the network, E! is reportedly in the early stages of developing a scripted pilot from writer Michael Patrick King called Juicy Stories.  On Tuesday night, Arrangement creator Jonathan Abrahams fielded tweets from disappointed fans of the show. In reply to a question about whether depressed ratings in Season 2 ultimately doomed the series, he wrote: ""Yes. Definitely not for the reason that other show got canceled today...""

The “Law & Order: SVU” beauty, who finalized her contentious divorce from chef Flay last year, and Benton — the mogul behind high-flying tech fund Andor Capital Management — were spotted “looking very close” at a black-tie Whitney Museum gala on Tuesday where Leonard Lauder was honored.  A source further said that March and Benton have been together since October — “very quietly dating for six months,” said the source, adding the two are “crazy about each other.”  March was beaming in a pink gown with Benton by her side at the Whitney gala that was a sea of black frocks and tuxes. Among guests were artists Chuck Close, Ed Ruscha, Brice Marden and Frank Stella, gallerists Barbara Gladstone and Arne Glimcher, arts patrons Brooke Garber Neidich, Beth Rudin DeWoody and Anne Bass, museum director Adam Weinberg, and Ronald and Jo Carole Lauder.  Benton, who’s divorced from Axel Capital Management founder Anna Nikolayevsky, bought a 730 Park Ave. duplex in 2012 with his then-wife for $39 million. Harvard MBA whiz Benton launched Andor in 2001 after he was Wall Street’s fourth-highest earner in 2000 — making $100 million, behind Steve Cohen, who was No. 2 with $137 million, according to Forbes. Andor holds stakes in Tesla, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon.  In comparison, Flay’s reported net worth is a meager $20 million. He and March finalized their divorce last summer after their 10-year marriage ended, and they were reportedly battling over a prenup that would pay March just $5,000 per month.  March said in an interview last October, around the time she began dating Benton, “It’s been quite a year,” and she wanted to “[hug] everyone I love 1,000 times over . . .

0f00a80f-1418-4a12-a6d2-a6b7fd45690c,"When I first walked into the Astros’ offices, which are located in the shell of Houston’s old Union Station abutting Minute Maid Park, on the morning of June 4, 2014, the club was still the laughingstock of baseball. Since the start of the 2011 season, the Astros had lost nearly twice as many games, 358, as they had won, 187. Worse, they were run by executives who were still viewed as know-it-all baseball outsiders—like the G.M., former management consultant Jeff Luhnow, and the so-called Director of Decision Sciences, the former NASA engineer Sig Mejdal—even though the men had at that point worked within the game for a decade. Worst of all, Luhnow and his execs were openly violating the baseball compact by which rebuilding teams were supposed to obscure their long-term plan by maintaining the illusion that they were genuinely trying to win each and every year, even if it meant losing just a little less.  “When you’re in 2017, you don’t really care that much about whether you lost 98 or 107 in 2012,” Luhnow said back then. “You care about how close we are to winning a championship in 2017.” In other words, they were entirely focused on several years down the line, which meant shedding every one of their expensive assets and starting from scratch. People hated it.  Still, a few days later I flew back to New York with the makings of a 5,000-word story that would appear in the June 24 issue Sports Illustrated, with a bold cover line: YOUR 2017 WORLD SERIES CHAMPS featuring the sorry Astros. SI’s editor Chris Stone and I, along with baseball editor Emma Span, had consulted on the proper year to choose. We settled on 2017 because the Astros’ young nucleus would by then be reaching its prime, because it seemed to more or less hew to the front office’s own timeline—which, they promised, would eventually include a payroll hike—and because three years, in baseball, is actually not the blink of an eye.  But many people, including some within our own office, hated the cover, too. Even the club’s own hometown paper, the Houston Chronicle, called it “more of an attention-grabbing, perhaps even tongue-in-cheek projection than a prediction.”  It was certainly a long shot, but so is everything in baseball. Vegas usually assigns a given season’s spring favorite less than a 20% chance of winning that fall’s World Series. What it wasn’t was empty clickbait, or a hot take. While we’re never above generating interesting conversations, my editors and I genuinely believed that what I saw down in Houston could result in a ring in three seasons. Now, the Astros are four games away from coming through on that prediction.  Of course, immediately after the issue reached mailboxes and newsstands, the Astros seemed to draw further away from the meeting the deadline we’d publicly set for them, in ways I described last month in an SI feature which focused on their recent last second trade for Justin Verlander. The 2015 Rookie of the Year, shortstop Carlos Correa, spent the second half of the season on the bench with a broken leg. George Springer, who had appeared on the cover, hit the DL. Their proprietary database, Ground Control, was revealed to have been hacked—by, it turned out, the former Cardinals scouting director Chris Correa, a former coworker of Luhnow’s and of several other Houston executives when they were all with St. Louis. (Correa—who, court documents suggested, was driven to increase his hacking efforts out of jealousy spurred by the SI cover, is now serving a 46-month prison sentence for unauthorized access of a protected computer.) Luhnow failed to sign the No. 1 pick in the 2014 draft, high school lefthander Brady Aiken, after the club detected an issue with Aiken’s elbow and decreased its offer to him. One of the Astros’ minor league stadiums flooded, and another caught on fire.  There were other mishaps and missteps along the way. “If we ever catch ourselves feeling smart, all we have to do is turn on SportsCenter,” Mejdal told me. There, as often as not, they could catch J.D. Martinez hitting another home run—the same J.D. Martinez whom Houston cut outright in March 2014, and who since then has an OPS (.936) higher than all but six other hitters in the majors. If Martinez wasn’t homering that night, then Kris Bryant probably was, the same Kris Bryant on whom the Astros passed with the top overall pick in 2013, in favor of the polished college pitcher Mark Appel. Appel had a 5.60 ERA in Triple-A this season—in the Phillies organization, where he was traded in December of 2015. Bryant, whom the Cubs picked No. 2 in `13, is the reigning NL MVP.  The Astros, though, never claimed to own a crystal ball, or that they would never make a mistake. They always expected to make many of them. Their goal was to make marginally more correct decisions than their competitors, in the long haul, and to do so they implemented an analytically rigorous system that not only processed all of the bleeding edge metrics they could find or create, but also heavily incorporated data from old fashioned sources: scouts, who could see things about a player’s potential and character that numbers couldn’t.  Many of those decisions have now paid off. Such as surprising baseball by drafting Correa—Carlos, not Chris—with the top pick in 2012, a move heavily endorsed by current assistant G.M. Mike Elias and one which not only gave them a star shortstop but also the financial room to choose starter Lance McCullers 41st overall. In McCullers’ most recent appearance, he shut out the Yankees over the final four innings of Game 7 of the ALCS. And declining to sign Aiken—who would indeed blow out his elbow nine months after the draft—and thus receiving a compensatory pick that they would use the next year on third baseman Alex Bregman, who has emerged as the star of the 2015 draft and was last seen making the pivotal and most risky defensive play of Game 7, nailing Greg Bird at home to keep the Yankees scoreless.  How about trading for Verlander, even though their metrics didn’t at all favor sacrificing three promising prospects for a 34-year-old with a contract guaranteeing him $28 million a year? It’s virtually impossible to imagine them making the World Series without the ALCS MVP. Or signing expensive free agents this past winter, like Carlos Beltran (one year, $16 million), Charlie Morton (two years, $14 million) and Josh Reddick (four years, $52 million)? Or hanging on to selected young players they’d inherited from the previous front office, particularly Springer, Jose Altuve and Dallas Keuchel?  Luck played its role, too—but the Astros’ plan, and the extended timeframe for their rebuilding effort permitted by owner Jim Crane, allowed room for good fortune. In the first season after Luhnow and his crew took over, 2012, Keuchel was a clean-shaven 24-year-old rookie who walked more batters (39) than he struck out (38), and Altuve was an undersized slap-hitter with nine career home runs. The front office had no idea that Keuchel would develop a devastating breaking ball and a more athletic delivery, as well as extraordinary facial hair, to become a Cy Young winner, or that Altuve, though still undersized, would develop into a power hitting, probable MVP. What they had was time to allow unexpected things like that to happen, as well as the analytical horsepower to expose players to every conceivable pathway by which they might improve.  Now they’re on the cusp of doing a few of the most unexpected thing of all: no, not making it seem as if we at Sports Illustrated know what we’re talking about—though, thanks for that—but winning the World Series just three years after completing their sixth straight losing season.  They’re still the underdog. Of eight SI baseball staffers who on Monday predicted the World Series’ outcome, just one picked the Astros to beat the Dodgers, and you can probably guess who that was without clicking that link. But even if they don’t do it this year, they are a team built to win in the long haul, as was always the plan. Just four members of the World Series roster—DH Carlos Beltran, outfielder Cameron Maybin and relievers Luke Gregerson and Francisco Liriano—will be free agents after the season, and none of them is nearly as vital as, say, Altuve, Correa, Keuchel, Springer or Verlander. And, with a payroll that still ranks around the league average of $150 million—an increase from a last-place $36 million just four years ago—they will have the wherewithal to spend more, too.  The most remarkable thing of all about the Astros is this: they told everyone exactly what they were going to do—and then they did it. That sort of confidence might not make them beloved within certain baseball circles. But whether they win or lose in the next nine days, it’s now impossible to doubt that they’ve been on to something all along.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1767
